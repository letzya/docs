## What is Tyk Open Source

Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our [Github](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk).

The Tyk Gateway is fully open-source.  It's all the same Gateway that's used by you (the community!), by our enterprise products, as well as our SaaS.

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: sign up for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, get started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

## Quick Start Tyk Gateway
New to Tyk Gateway? On this page you'll get started with the basics - install Tyk and test it live in less than 2 minutes.

We recommend [Tyk Gateway docker compose](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker) as the quickest way to get started. If you want to deploy it in a specific platform check our [installation options](/#installation-options-for-tyk-gateway) page.

**Step 1 - Clone the docker-compose repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker
```

**Step 2 - Change to the new directory**
```
cd tyk-gateway-docker
```

**Step 3 - Deploy Tyk Gateway and Redis**
```
docker-compose up
```

You can also run this in detached mode using the _-d_ flag:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Congratulations, you’re done!!!

### Test Installation

Your Tyk Gateway is now configured and ready to use. Confirm this by checking against the ‘hello’ endpoint:

```curl
curl localhost:8080/hello
```

The output should be similar to that shown below:
```json
{"status": "pass", "version": "v5.1", "description": "Tyk GW"}
```

### Install Tyk Gateway with Docker

We will show you two methods of installing our Community Edition Gateway on Docker.
The quickest way to get started is using docker-compose. Visit our [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tykio/) to view the official images.

#### Prerequisites

The following are required for a Tyk OSS installation:
 - Redis   - Required for all Tyk installations.
             Simple Redis installation instructions are included below.
 - MongoDB - Required only if you chose to use the Tyk Pump with your Tyk OSS installation. Same goes with any [other pump data stores](/api-management/tyk-pump#external-data-stores) you choose to use.

#### Steps for Installation

1. **Create a network**

```bash
docker network create tyk
```

2. **Deploy Redis into the network, with the `6379` port open**

```bash
docker run -itd --rm --name tyk-redis --network tyk -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 redis:4.0-alpine
```

3. **Next, let's download a JSON `tyk.conf` configuration file**

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker/master/tyk.standalone.conf
```

4. **Run the Gateway, mounting the conf file into the container**

```bash
docker run \
  --name tyk_gateway \
  --network tyk \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/tyk.standalone.conf:/opt/tyk-gateway/tyk.conf \
  -v $(pwd)/apps:/opt/tyk-gateway/apps \
  docker.tyk.io/tyk-gateway/tyk-gateway:latest
```


#### Test Installation

Your Tyk Gateway is now configured and ready to use. Confirm this by making a network request to the 'hello' endpoint:

```curl
curl localhost:8080/hello
```

Output should be similar to that shown below:
```json
{"status":"pass","version":"v3.2.1","description":"Tyk GW"}
```


### Install Tyk Gateway with Kubernetes

The main way to install the Open Source *Tyk Gateway* in a Kubernetes cluster is via Helm charts. 
We are actively working to add flexibility and more user flows to our chart. Please reach out
to our teams on support or the community forum if you have questions, requests or suggestions for improvements.

Get started with our [Quick Start guide](/#quick-start-with-helm-chart) or go to [Tyk Open Source helm chart](/product-stack/tyk-charts/tyk-oss-chart) for detailed installation instructions and configuration options.

#### Quick Start with Helm Chart

At the end of this quick start, Tyk Gateway should be accessible through the service `gateway-svc-tyk-oss-tyk-gateway` at port `8080`. 
The following guides provide instructions to install Redis and Tyk Open Source with default configurations. It is intended for a quick start only. For production, you should install and configure Redis separately. 

##### Prerequisites

1. [Kubernetes 1.19+](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
2. [Helm 3+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

##### Steps for Installation

1. **Install Redis and Tyk**

```bash
NAMESPACE=tyk-oss
APISecret=foo
REDIS_BITNAMI_CHART_VERSION=19.0.2

helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update

helm upgrade tyk-redis oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/redis -n $NAMESPACE --install --version $REDIS_BITNAMI_CHART_VERSION

helm upgrade tyk-oss tyk-helm/tyk-oss -n $NAMESPACE --create-namespace \
  --install \
  --set global.secrets.APISecret="$APISecret" \
  --set global.redis.addrs="{tyk-redis-master.$NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local:6379}" \
  --set global.redis.passSecret.name=tyk-redis \
  --set global.redis.passSecret.keyName=redis-password
```

2. **Done!**

Now Tyk Gateway should be accessible through service `gateway-svc-tyk-oss-tyk-gateway` at port `8080`. 

You are now ready to [create an API](/api-management/gateway-config-managing-classic#create-an-api).

For the complete installation guide and configuration options, please see [Tyk OSS Helm Chart](/product-stack/tyk-charts/tyk-oss-chart).

#### Configure Legacy Tyk Headless Helm Chart

<Warning>
`tyk-headless` chart is deprecated. Please use our Tyk Chart for Tyk Open Source at [tyk-oss](/#quick-start-with-helm-chart) instead. 

We recommend all users migrate to the `tyk-oss` Chart. Please review the [Configuration](/#quick-start-with-helm-chart) section of the new helm chart and cross-check with your existing configurations while planning for migration.
</Warning>


This is the preferred (and easiest) way to install the Tyk OSS Gateway on Kubernetes.
It will install Tyk gateway in your Kubernetes cluster where you can add and manage APIs directly or via the *Tyk Operator*.

##### Prerequisites

The following are required for a Tyk OSS installation:
1. Redis   - required for all the Tyk installations and must be installed in the cluster or reachable from inside K8s.
             You can find instructions for a simple Redis installation below.
2. MongoDB/SQL - Required only if you choose to use the MongoDB/SQL Tyk pump with your Tyk OSS installation. The same goes for any
             [other pump](/api-management/tyk-pump#external-data-stores) you choose to use.
3. Helm - Tyk Helm supports the Helm 3+ version.

##### Steps for Installation

As well as our official OSS Helm repo, you can also find it in [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-headless).
As well as our official OSS Helm repo, you can also find it on [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-headless).

> **tyk-headless**: This chart deploys the open-source Tyk Gateway. Tyk Gateway is a fully open-source Enterprise API Gateway, supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP, and gRPC protocols. It is ‘Batteries-included’, with no feature lockout. It enables organizations and businesses around the world to protect, secure, and process APIs as well as review and audit the consumed APIs.

👉 [Open in ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-headless)


If you are interested in contributing to our charts, suggesting changes, creating PRs, or any other way,
please use [GitHub Tyk-helm-chart repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-helm-chart/tree/master/tyk-headless)

1. **Add Tyk official Helm repo**

```bash
helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update
```

2. **Create a namespace for Tyk deployment**

```bash
kubectl create namespace tyk
```

3. **Getting values.yaml**

Before we proceed with installation of the chart you may need to set some custom values.
To see what options are configurable on a chart and save those options to a custom `values.yaml` file run:

```bash
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-headless > values.yaml
```

Some of the necessary configuration parameters will be explained in the next steps.

4. **Installing Redis**

* Recommended: via *Bitnami* chart - For Redis, you can use these rather excellent chart provided by Bitnami.
Copy the following commands to add it: 

  ```bash
  helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
  helm install tyk-redis bitnami/redis -n tyk --version 19.0.2
  ```


<Note>
Please make sure you are installing Redis versions that are supported by Tyk. Please refer to Tyk docs to get a list of [supported versions](/#supported-versions).
</Note>


Follow the notes from the installation output to get connection details and password.

```
  Redis(TM) can be accessed on the following DNS names from within your cluster:

    tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read/write operations (port 6379)
    tyk-redis-replicas.tyk.svc.cluster.local for read-only operations (port 6379)

  export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace tyk tyk-redis -o jsonpath="{.data.redis-password}" | base64 --decode)
```

The DNS name of your Redis as set by Bitnami is `tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc.cluster.local:6379`
You can update them in your local `values.yaml` file under `redis.addrs` and `redis.pass`
Alternatively, you can use `--set` flag to set it in the Tyk installation. For example  `--set redis.pass=$REDIS_PASSWORD`

**For evaluation only: Use *simple-redis* chart**


<Warning>
Another option for Redis, to get started quickly, is to use our *simple-redis* chart.
Please note that these provided charts must never be used in production or for anything
but a quick start evaluation only. Use Bitnami Redis or Official Redis Helm chart in any other case.
We provide this chart, so you can quickly deploy *Tyk gateway*, but it is not meant for long-term storage of data.
</Warning>


```bash
helm install redis tyk-helm/simple-redis -n tyk
```

5. **Installing Tyk Open Source Gateway**

```bash
helm install tyk-ce tyk-helm/tyk-headless -f values.yaml -n tyk
 ```

Please note that by default, Gateway runs as `Deployment` with `ReplicaCount` as 1. You should not update this part because multiple instances of OSS gateways won't sync the API Definition.

##### Installation Video

See our short video on how to install the Tyk Open Source Gateway.
Please note that this video shows the use of the Github repository since it was recorded before the official repo was available, However,
it's very similar to the above commands.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkyl38sBAF0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

##### Pump Installation
By default pump installation is disabled. You can enable it by setting `pump.enabled` to `true` in `values.yaml` file.
Alternatively, you can use `--set pump.enabled=true` while doing Helm install.

**Quick Pump configuration(Supported from tyk helm v0.10.0)**
*1. Mongo Pump*

To configure the Mongo pump, make the following changes in `values.yaml` file:
1. Set `backend` to `mongo`.
2. Set connection string in `mongo.mongoURL`.

*2. Postgres Pump*

To configure the Postgres pump, make the following changes in `values.yaml` file:
1. Set `backend` to `postgres`.
2. Set connection string parameters in `postgres` section.

##### Optional - Using TLS
You can turn on the TLS option under the gateway section in your local `values.yaml` file which will make your Gateway
listen on port 443 and load up a dummy certificate.
You can set your own default certificate by replacing the file in the `certs/` folder.

##### Optional - Mounting Files
To mount files to any of the Tyk stack components, add the following to the mounts array in the section of that component.

For example:
 ```bash
 - name: aws-mongo-ssl-cert
  filename: rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
  mountPath: /etc/certs
```

##### Optional - Tyk Ingress
To set up an ingress for your Tyk Gateways see our [Tyk Operator GitHub repository](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-operator).


### Install Tyk Gateway with Ansible

#### Prerequisites

1. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) is required to run the following commands.
2. Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).

#### Steps for Installation
1. Clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. `cd` into the directory
```.bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. Run the init script to initialize the environment

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify the `hosts.yml` file to update SSH variables to your server(s). For more information about the host file, visit the [Ansible inventory documentation] (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. Run ansible-playbook to install `tyk-ce`

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -t tyk-ce -t redis
```

You can choose to not install Redis by removing the `-t redis`. However, Redis is a requirement and needs to be installed for the gateway to run.

### Install Tyk Gateway with Ubuntu

The Tyk Gateway can be installed following different installation methods including *Ansible* and *Shell*. Please select by clicking the tab with the installation path most suitable for you.

#### Install Tyk Gateway On Ubuntu Through Shell

##### 

| Distribution | Version | Supported |
| --------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| Debian | 11 | ✅ |
| Ubuntu | 20 | ✅ |
| Ubuntu | 18 | ✅ |
| Ubuntu | 16 | ✅ |

##### Prerequisites

1. Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).

##### Steps for Installation

1. **Install Redis**

```console
$ sudo apt-get install -y redis-server
```

2. **First import the public key as required by Ubuntu APT**

```console
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
```

3. **Run Installation Scripts via our PackageCloud Repositories**

From [https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway) you have the following options:

* Via the correct package for your Ubuntu version. We have packages for the following:
 * Xenial
 * Trusty
 * Precise

* Via Quick Installation Instructions. You can use: 
 * [Manual Instructions](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#manual-deb)
 * [Chef](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#chef)
 * [Puppet](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/install#puppet)
 * [CI and Build Tools](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/ci)

4. **Configure The Gateway**

You can set up the core settings for the Tyk Gateway with a single setup script, however for more involved deployments, you will want to provide your own configuration file.


<Note>
You need to replace `<hostname>` for `--redishost=<hostname>` with your own value to run this script.
</Note>



```console
$ sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --listenport=8080 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379 --domain=""
```

What you've done here is tell the setup script that:

*   `--listenport=8080`: Listen on port `8080` for API traffic.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: The hostname for Redis.
*   `--redisport=6379`: Use port `6379` for Redis.
*   `--domain=""`: Do not filter domains for the Gateway, see the note on domains below for more about this.

In this example, you don't want Tyk to listen on a single domain. It is recommended to leave the Tyk Gateway domain unbounded for flexibility and ease of deployment.

5. **Starting Tyk**

The Tyk Gateway can be started now that it is configured. Use this command to start the Tyk Gateway:
```console
$ sudo service tyk-gateway start
```

### Install Tyk Gateway on Red Hat (RHEL / CentOS)

The Tyk Gateway can be installed following different installation methods including *Shell* and *Ansible*. Please select by clicking the tab with the installation path most suitable for you.

#### Install Tyk Gateway Through Shell

##### Supported Distributions

| Distribution | Version | Supported |
| --------- | :---------: | :---------: |
| CentOS | 8 | ✅ |
| CentOS | 7 | ✅ |
| RHEL | 8 | ✅ |
| RHEL | 7 | ✅ |

##### Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process, make sure you have the following:

*   Ensure port `8080` is open for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).
*   The Tyk Gateway has a [dependency](#supported-versions) on Redis. Follow the steps provided by Red Hat to make the installation of Redis, conducting a [search](https://access.redhat.com/search/?q=redis) for the correct version and distribution.

##### Steps for Installation 
1. **Create Tyk Gateway Repository Configuration**

Create a file named `/etc/yum.repos.d/tyk_tyk-gateway.repo` that contains the repository configuration settings for YUM repositories `tyk_tyk-gateway` and `tyk_tyk-gateway-source` used to download packages from the specified URLs. This includes GPG key verification and SSL settings, on a Linux system.

Make sure to replace `el` and `8` in the config below with your Linux distribution and version:
```bash
[tyk_tyk-gateway]
name=tyk_tyk-gateway
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/el/8/$basearch
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/gpgkey
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300

[tyk_tyk-gateway-source]
name=tyk_tyk-gateway-source
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/el/8/SRPMS
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/tyk/tyk-gateway/gpgkey
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300
```

Update your local yum cache by running:
```bash
sudo yum -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='tyk_tyk-gateway'
```

2. **Install Tyk Gateway**

Install the Tyk Gateway using yum:
```bash
sudo yum install -y tyk-gateway
```

<Note>
You may be asked to accept the GPG key for our two repos and when the package installs, hit yes to continue.
</Note>


3. **Start Redis**

If Redis is not running then start it using the following command:
```bash
sudo service redis start
```
4. **Configuring The Gateway**

You can set up the core settings for the Tyk Gateway with a single setup script, however for more complex deployments you will want to provide your own configuration file.


<Note>
Replace `<hostname>` in `--redishost=<hostname>` with your own value to run this script.
</Note>


```bash
sudo /opt/tyk-gateway/install/setup.sh --listenport=8080 --redishost=<hostname> --redisport=6379 --domain=""
```

What you've done here is told the setup script that:

*   `--listenport=8080`: Listen on port `8080` for API traffic.
*   `--redishost=<hostname>`: The hostname for Redis.
*   `--redisport=6379`: Use port `6379` for Redis.
*   `--domain=""`: Do not filter domains for the Gateway, see the note on domains below for more about this.

In this example, you don't want Tyk to listen on a single domain. It is recommended to leave the Tyk Gateway domain unbounded for flexibility and ease of deployment.

5. **Start the Tyk Gateway**

The Tyk Gateway can be started now that it is configured. Use this command to start the Tyk Gateway:
```bash
sudo service tyk-gateway start
```

#### Install Tyk Gateway Through Ansible

2. [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) - required for running the commands below.
3. Ensure port `8080` is open: this is used in this guide for Gateway traffic (the API traffic to be proxied).

##### Steps for Installation

1. **Clone the [tyk-ansible](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible) repository**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-ansible
```

2. **`cd` into the directory**
```bash
$ cd tyk-ansible
```

3. **Run the initalisation script to initialise your environment**

```bash
$ sh scripts/init.sh
```

4. Modify the `hosts.yml` file to update ssh variables to your server(s). You can learn more about the hosts file [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)

5. **Run ansible-playbook to install `tyk-gateway-ce`**

```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml -t tyk-gateway-ce -t redis
```

<Note>
Installation flavors can be specified by using the -t {tag} at the end of the ansible-playbook command. In this case we are using:
  -`tyk-gateway-ce`: Tyk Gateway with CE config
  -`redis`: Redis database as Tyk Gateway dependency

### Install Tyk Gateway on Killercoda

[Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/about) gives you instant access to a real Linux or Kubernetes command-line environment via your browser. 
You can try this [Killercoda Tyk scenario](https://killercoda.com/tyk-tutorials/scenario/Tyk-install-OSS-docker-compose) to walk through the installation of our Open Source Gateway using Docker Compose (the exact same flow shown above).

## Configuration Options for Redis

### Configure Redis Cluster

Our Gateway, Dashboard and Pump all support integration with Redis Cluster. Redis Cluster allows data to be automatically sharded across multiple Redis Nodes. To setup Redis Cluster correctly, we recommend you read the [Redis Cluster Tutorial](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial). You must use the same settings across the Gateway, Dashboard and Pump.


<Note>
Redis Cluster operates differently from a Redis setup where one instance serves as the primary and others as replicas.
</Note>


#### Supported Versions
- Tyk 5.3 supports Redis 6.2.x, 7.0.x, and 7.2.x
- Tyk 5.2.x and earlier supports Redis 6.0.x and Redis 6.2.x only.


#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Gateway 

To configure the Tyk Gateway to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `tyk.conf` file.


<Note>
`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated.
</Note>


If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true`.

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Dashboard


<Note>
`redis_addrs` is new in v1.9.3 for the Dashboard, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated.
</Note>



```json
"redis_addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
"redis_use_ssl": true,
"enable_cluster": true
```
To configure the Tyk Dashboard to work with your Redis Cluster, add the Redis address information to your `tyk_analytics.conf` file:


#### Redis Cluster and Tyk Pump

To configure the Tyk Pump to work with your Redis Cluster, set `enable_cluster` to `true` and list your servers under `addrs` in your `pump.conf` file.


<Note>
`addrs` is new in v2.9.3, and replaces `hosts` which is now deprecated.
</Note>



```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Cluster with Docker

For Redis clustered mode to work with Tyk using Docker and Amazon ElastiCache, follow these two steps:

1. **Make sure cluster mode is enabled**

Set the environment variable `TYK_GW_STORAGE_ENABLECLUSTER` to `true`.

2. **Add all cluster endpoints to the config**

Add all the Redis Cluster endpoints into Tyk, not just the primary. If Tyk can't see the whole cluster, then it will not work.

For ElastiCache Redis, you can bypass having to list all your nodes, and instead just use the *configuration endpoint*,
this allows read and write operations and the endpoint will determine the correct node to target.

If this does not work, you can still list out the hosts using an environment variable. To do so, set the environment variable:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_ADDRS="redis_primary1:port,redis_replica1:port,redis_primary2:port,redis_replica2:port,redis_primary3:port,redis_replica3:port"
```

It is important that Tyk can connect to all primary and replica instances.

It is recommended to ensure that the connection pool is big enough. To do so, set the following environment variables:

```{.copyWrapper}
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXIDLE=6000
TYK_GW_STORAGE_MAXACTIVE=10000
```

<Note>
These are suggested settings, please verify them by load testing.
</Note>


##### Redis Cluster with TLS

If you are using TLS for Redis connections, set `use_ssl` to `true` for Gateway and Pump, and `redis_use_ssl` to `true` for the dashboard.
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) from version 6 as an optional feature, enhancing the security of data in transit. Similarly, Amazon ElastiCache offers encryption in transit and at rest. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:

- `storage.use_ssl`: Set this to true to enable TLS encryption for the connection.

- `storage.ssl_insecure_skip_verify`: A flag that, when set to true, instructs the application not to verify the Redis server's TLS certificate. This is not recommended for production due to the risk of `man-in-the-middle` attacks.

From **Tyk 5.3**, additional options are available for more granular control:

- `storage.ca_file`: Path to the Certificate Authority (CA) file for verifying the Redis server's certificate.

- `storage.cert_file` and `storage.key_file`: Paths to your application's certificate and private key files, necessary for mTLS where both parties verify each other's identity.

- `storage.max_version` and `storage.min_version`: Define the acceptable range of TLS versions, enhancing security by restricting connections to secure TLS protocols (1.2 or 1.3).

**Setting up an Insecure TLS Connection**
- **Enable TLS**: By setting `"use_ssl": true`, you encrypt the connection.
- **Skip Certificate Verification**: Setting `"ssl_insecure_skip_verify": true` bypasses the server's certificate verification, suitable only for non-production environments.

**Setting up a Secure TLS Connection**
- Ensure `use_ssl` is set to `true`.
- Set `ssl_insecure_skip_verify` to `false` to enforce certificate verification against the CA specified in `ca_file`.
- Specify the path to the CA file in `ca_file` for server certificate verification.
- Adjust `min_version` and `max_version` to secure TLS versions, ideally 1.2 and 1.3.

**Setting up a Mutual TLS (mTLS) Connection**
- Follow the steps for a secure TLS connection.
- Provide paths for `cert_file` and `key_file` for your application's TLS certificate and private key, enabling Redis server to verify your application's identity.

**Example Gateway Configuration**
```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:6379",
    "server2:6380",
    "server3:6381"
  ],
  "use_ssl": true,
  "ssl_insecure_skip_verify": false,
  "ca_file": "/path/to/ca.crt",
  "cert_file": "/path/to/client.crt",
  "key_file": "/path/to/client.key",
  "max_version": "1.3",
  "min_version": "1.2",
  "enable_cluster": true,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000
}
```

##### Troubleshooting Redis Cluster

If you find that Tyk components fail to initialise when using Redis clustering, for example the application does not start and the last log file entry shows a message such as `Using clustered mode`, try setting the environment variable `REDIGOCLUSTER_SHARDCOUNT` to `128` on all hosts which connect to the Redis Cluster i.e. Gateway, Dashboard, Pump, MDCB. E.g.

`REDIGOCLUSTER_SHARDCOUNT=128`

If setting to `128` does not resolve the issue, try `256` instead.


### Configure Redis Sentinel

From v2.9.3 Redis Sentinel is supported.

Similar to Redis Cluster, our Gateway, Dashboard and Pump all support integration with Redis Sentinel.

To configure Tyk to work with Redis Sentinel, list your servers under `addrs` and set the master name in your Gateway, Dashboard, Pump and MDCB config. Unlike Redis Cluster, `enable_cluster` should **not** be set.  Indicative config snippets as follows:

#### Supported Versions
- Tyk 5.3 supports Redis 6.2.x, 7.0.x, and 7.2.x
- Tyk 5.2.x and earlier supports Redis 6.0.x and Redis 6.2.x only.


#### Redis Sentinel and Gateway

```json
"storage": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 2000,
  "optimisation_max_active": 4000,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```

#### Redis Sentinel and Dashboard

```json
"redis_addrs": [
  "server1:26379",
  "server2:26379",
  "server3:26379"
],
"redis_master_name": "mymaster"
```

#### Redis Sentinel and Pump

```json
"analytics_storage_config": {
  "type": "redis",
  "addrs": [
    "server1:26379",
    "server2:26379",
    "server3:26379"
  ],
  "master_name": "mymaster",
  "username": "",
  "password": "",
  "database": 0,
  "optimisation_max_idle": 100,
  "use_ssl": false
},
```


<Warning>
When using Bitnami charts to install Redis Sentinel in k8s, a Redis service is exposed, which means that standard Redis config is required instead of the above setup, i.e. a single server in `addrs` and `master_name` is not required.
</Warning>


#### Support for Redis Sentinel AUTH

To support the use of Redis Sentinel AUTH (introduced in Redis 5.0.1) we have added the following global config settings in Tyk v3.0.2:

* In the Tyk Gateway config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Dashboard config file - `redis_sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Pump config file - `sentinel_password`
* In the Tyk Identity Broker config file - `SentinelPassword`
* In the Tyk Synk config file - `sentinel_password`

These settings allow you to support Sentinel password-only authentication in Redis version 5.0.1 and above.

See the Redis and Sentinel authentication section of the [Redis Sentinel docs](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) for more details.

#### Configure Redis TLS Encryption
Redis supports [SSL/TLS encryption](https://redis.io/topics/encryption) from version 6 as an optional feature, enhancing the security of data in transit. To configure TLS or mTLS connections between an application and Redis, consider the following settings in Tyk's configuration files:
