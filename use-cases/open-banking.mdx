## Introduction

Open Banking is a financial services framework that enables secure data sharing between banks and third-party providers (TPPs) through standardized APIs. It fosters innovation, enhances customer experiences, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements such as:
- **Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)** ([PSD2](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html)) in the European Union, mandating secure access to account information and payment services.
- **UK Open Banking** ([UK Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/)), a UK initiative for standardized financial APIs.
- **Consumer Data Right (CDR)** ([CDR](https://www.cdr.gov.au/)) in Australia, enabling consumer data sharing.
- **Financial Data Exchange (FDX)** ([FDX](https://financialdataexchange.org/)) in the United States, an industry-led standard for data sharing.

Open Banking is enabling the banking industry to move from closed ecosystems to open standards and collaborative platforms where customer data can be securely shared with authorized third parties. However, financial institutions face challenges implementing secure, compliant, Open Banking APIs. This document explores how [Tyk API Gateway](/tyk-oss-gateway), through its [FAPI Accelerator](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-fapi), enables financial institutions to implement robust Open Banking APIs.

## Challenges in Financial Services API Implementation

Implementing Open Banking APIs presents several challenges:

1. **Stringent Security Requirements**:
   - Compliance with **Financial-grade API (FAPI)** standards, such as FAPI 2.0, which ensure high-security API interactions.
   - Ensuring data integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation for sensitive financial transactions.

2. **Complex Authentication**:
   - Implementing **OAuth 2.0** with features like **Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)** ([PAR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126)) and **Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)** ([DPoP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449)).
   - Managing secure user consent and authorization flows.

3. **Event Notifications**:
   - Enabling TPPs to subscribe to real-time updates about account and payment events.
   - Signing notifications with cryptographic signatures for security.

4. **Idempotency**:
   - Ensuring that duplicate requests (especially for payments) don't result in duplicate transactions.

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - Providing a seamless experience for TPP developers while maintaining high-security standards.

## What is Tyk FAPI Accelerator?

The **[Tyk FAPI Accelerator](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-fapi)** is a reference implementation provided by Tyk Technologies to help financial institutions build secure, standards-compliant Open Banking APIs. Built on the [Tyk API Gateway](/tyk-oss-gateway).

### Security Features

The Tyk FAPI Accelerator implements several security features required for financial-grade APIs:

1. **DPoP (Demonstrating Proof of Possession)**:
   - Ensures the client possesses the private key corresponding to the public key in the token
   - Prevents token theft and replay attacks
   - Implemented as a gRPC plugin for Tyk Gateway

2. **JWS Signing for Event Notifications**:
   - Signs webhook notifications with JSON Web Signatures (JWS)
   - Ensures authenticity and integrity of notifications
   - Allows TPPs to verify the source of notifications

3. **Idempotency Support**:
   - Prevents duplicate transactions from repeated API calls
   - Caches responses for idempotent requests
   - Includes automatic garbage collection of expired entries

4. **OAuth 2.0 with PAR**:
   - Implements Pushed Authorization Requests for enhanced security
   - Supports both automatic and manual authorization flows
   - Complies with FAPI 2.0 security profile

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User as End User
    participant TPP as TPP Application
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authorization Server
    participant Bank as Tyk Bank
    participant DB as Database
    participant Kafka as Message Broker
    
    %% Payment Initiation
    User->>TPP: 1. Initiate payment (amount, recipient)
    
    %% Payment Consent Creation
    TPP->>Gateway: 2. Create payment consent
    Gateway->>Bank: 3. Forward consent request
    Bank->>DB: 4. Store consent
    DB-->>Bank: 5. Return consent ID
    Bank-->>Gateway: 6. Consent response with ConsentId
    Gateway-->>TPP: 7. Return ConsentId
    
    %% Pushed Authorization Request (PAR)
    TPP->>Auth: 8. Push Authorization Request (PAR)
    Note right of TPP: Direct connection to Auth Server
    Auth-->>TPP: 9. Return request_uri
    
    %% Authorization Options
    TPP->>User: 10. Display authorization options
    
    %% Two possible authorization flows
    alt Automatic Authorization
        User->>TPP: 11a. Select automatic authorization
        TPP->>Bank: 12a. Direct authorize consent request
        Note right of TPP: Server-side authorization
        Bank->>DB: 13a. Update consent status
        DB-->>Bank: 14a. Confirm update
        Bank-->>TPP: 15a. Authorization confirmation
    else Manual Authorization
        User->>TPP: 11b. Select manual authorization
        TPP->>User: 12b. Redirect to authorization URL
        User->>Auth: 13b. Authorization request with request_uri
        Auth->>Bank: 14b. Verify consent
        Bank->>DB: 15b. Get consent details

    end
    
    %% Payment Creation

    TPP-->>Bank: 36. Acknowledge notification
```

### Event Notification Example

The event notification system allows TPPs to receive updates about payment status changes:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor TPP as TPP Application
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant EventAPI as Event Subscriptions API
    participant PaymentAPI as Payment Initiation API
    participant DB as Database
    participant Kafka as Message Broker
    
    %% Subscription Registration
    TPP->>Gateway: 1. Register callback URL
    Gateway->>EventAPI: 2. Forward registration request
    EventAPI->>DB: 3. Store subscription
    DB-->>EventAPI: 4. Return subscription ID
    EventAPI-->>Gateway: 5. Registration response with SubscriptionId
    Gateway-->>TPP: 6. Return SubscriptionId
    
    %% Event Generation
    Note over PaymentAPI: Payment status change or other event occurs
    PaymentAPI->>Kafka: 7. Publish event
    Note right of PaymentAPI: Event includes type, subject, timestamp
    
    %% Event Processing
    Kafka-->>Gateway: 8. Consume event
    Gateway->>DB: 9. Query subscriptions for event type
    DB-->>Gateway: 10. Return matching subscriptions
    Gateway->>Gateway: 11. Determine target TPPs and sign with JWS
    
    %% Notification Delivery
    Gateway->>TPP: 12. Send signed notification
    Note right of Gateway: Notification includes event details, links, and JWS signature
    TPP->>TPP: 13. Verify JWS signature
    TPP-->>Gateway: 14. Acknowledge (HTTP 200 OK)
    
    %% Error Handling (Alternative Flow)
    alt Delivery Failure
        Gateway->>TPP: 12. Send signed notification
        TPP--xGateway: 13. Failed delivery (timeout/error)
        Gateway->>Gateway: 14. Retry with exponential backoff
        Gateway->>TPP: 15. Retry notification
        TPP->>TPP: 16. Verify JWS signature
        TPP-->>Gateway: 17. Acknowledge (HTTP 200 OK)
    end
```
