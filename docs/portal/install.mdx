**Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal**

If you are interested in getting access to the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal, please contact us at [support@tyk.io](mailto:support@tyk.io)
</Info>

Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal is available as a Docker container. To install Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal, you need to launch the Docker image for the portal with a database to store the portal metadata. Optionally, you may decide to use S3 to store the portal CMS assets (image and theme files)

This guide explains how to install and bootstrap the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal. On average, it should take around 5-10 minutes to install it depending on your setup.

## Enterprise Developer Portal Components

</Frame>


The portal deployment comprises of three main components:

- The portal application itself
- The portal’s main database that stores metadata related to the portal, such as API products, plans, developers, applications, and more
- The asset storage, which stores CMS assets such as images, themes, and OpenAPI specification files. The assets could reside in the portal’s main database or separately in an S3 bucket or filesystem volume.

Optionally, there could be three additional components:

- **3rd party identity provider.** To [enable oAuth2.0 for your API Products](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/api-provider/#dynamic-client-registration), you’ll need to utilize an OpenID-compliant third-party identity provider. It’s essential to note that the [Tyk Stack](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/) doesn’t include third-party identity providers, so you should refer to your Identity Provider’s documentation for instructions on configuring and deploying it. This component is optional and required only for enabling oAuth2.0
- **[Tyk Identity Broker](https://tyk.io/docs/api-management/external-service-integration/)**. You only need this component if you want to configure Single Sign-On for the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal. For more guidance on this topic, please consult [the Single Sign-On section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/settings/#configure-developer-portal-sso) of the documentation
- **Email server**. The portal is capable of sending notifications to both admin users and developers when specific events happen within the portal. To enable this feature, you need to specify a connection configuration to an email server or service, and configure other email settings. You can choose to use a server that is installed on your premises or an SMTP-compatible SaaS product. For step-by-step instructions, please refer to [the Email Settings section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/customization/#configure-email-notifications)

## Portal Installation Process

The portal installation process comprises two steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the portal application">
    To install the portal and launch it in the bootstrap mode, you need to configure your portal instance by specifying settings such as TLS, log level, and database connection. For further guidance on launching the portal, please refer to one of the installation options: [Docker container](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#docker), [Docker Compose](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#docker-compose), [Helm chart](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#using-legacy-helm-chart), or [RPM package](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#linux-redhat-centos).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap the portal">
    After you’ve launched the portal, it will wait for you to provide credentials for the super admin user before it starts accepting traffic. Once you’ve created the super admin user, the portal will complete its installation process by creating the necessary database structure and initialising the required assets for its operations. You can [bootstrap](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) the portal either through the UI or using the bootstrap API. Please refer to [the Bootstrapping section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) for implementing this step.
  </Step>

### Docker

This section explains how to install Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal in a container using Docker. Depending on your preferences, you can use MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite as database.

In this recipe, the database and the portal container will run on the same network, with the database storing its data on a volume. The portal’s CMS assets (images, files and themes) are stored in the database, although this guide provides links to the documentation to use a persistent volume or an S3 bucket as a storage medium for CMS assets. Additionally, all settings for the Portal are configured using an env-file.

<Note>
This document is just an example. Customize all fields, including the username, password, root password, database name and more.

Be sure to update the connection DSN in the env-file accordingly.
</Note>

**Prerequisites** To successfully install the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal with Docker, you should have installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on the machine where you want to install the portal.

#### Using PostgreSQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a network for the portal deployment">
    To start with, you need to create a Docker network for communication between the database and the portal. Execute the following command to create it:
    ```console
	  docker network create tyk-portal
	  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an init script for PostgreSQL">
    To initialize a PostgreSQL database, you need to create an init script that will later be used to launch the PostgreSQL instance. Copy the content below to a file named `init.sql`, which you will need in the next step.
      ```sql
      -- init.sql
      -- Creating user
      CREATE USER admin WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secr3t';
      CREATE DATABASE portal;
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE portal TO admin;
      ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the database volume and launch the database">
    The next step is to launch the PostgreSQL database for the portal. To achieve this, create a data volume for the database first:
    ```console
    docker volume create tyk-portal-postgres-data
    ```
	Then launch the PostgreSQL instance by executing the following command:
    ```gdscript3
    docker run \
    -d \
    --name tyk-portal-postgres \
    --restart on-failure:5 \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secr3t \
    -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    --mount type=volume,source=tyk-portal-postgres-data,target=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    --mount type=bind,src=$(pwd)/init.sql,dst=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql \
    --network tyk-portal \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:10-alpine
    ```
  <Note>
    The above PostgreSQL configuration is an example. You can customize deployment of your PostgreSQL instance. Please refer to [the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html) for further guidance.
  </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an environment variables file">
	Creating an environment variables file to specify settings for the portal is the next step. This is optional, as you can alternatively specify all the variables using the -e option when starting your deployment.
	Here is an example of a sample environment file. For a comprehensive reference of environment variables, please refer to the [configuration section](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration/) in the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal documentation.
	```ini
	PORTAL_HOSTPORT=3001
	PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT=postgres
	PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING=host=tyk-portal-postgres port=5432 dbname=portal user=admin password=secr3t sslmode=disable
	PORTAL_DATABASE_ENABLELOGS=false
	PORTAL_THEMING_THEME=default
	PORTAL_STORAGE=db
	PORTAL_LICENSEKEY=<your-license-here>
	```
	Once you have completed this step, you are ready to launch the portal application with PostgreSQL in a Docker container.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pull and launch the portal container">
	To pull and launch the portal using Docker, use the command provided below. Ensure that you replace `<tag>` with the specific version of the portal you intend to launch before executing the command, e.g. `tykio/portal:v1.7` for the portal v1.7. You can browse all available versions on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/portal/tags) and in the [release notes section](https://tyk.io/docs/developer-support/release-notes/portal/#170-release-notes).
	```console
	docker run -d \
	    -p 3001:3001 \
	    --env-file .env \
	    --network tyk-portal \
	    --name tyk-portal \
	    tykio/portal:<tag>
	```
	This command will launch the portal on localhost at port 3001. Now, you can bootstrap the portal and start managing your API products.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap the portal">
	Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it’s the first time you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up">
	If you want to clean up your environment or start the installation process from scratch, execute the following commands to stop and remove the portal container:
	```console
	docker stop tyk-portal
	docker rm tyk-portal
	docker stop tyk-portal-postgres
	docker rm tyk-portal-postgres
	docker volume rm tyk-portal-postgres-data
	```
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ```console
    docker network create tyk-portal
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the database volume and launch the database">
    The next step is to launch the MySQL database for the portal. To achieve this, create a data volume for the database first:
    ```console
    docker volume create tyk-portal-mysql-data
    ```
    Then launch the MySQL instance by executing the following command:
    ```console
    docker run \
    -d \
    --name tyk-portal-mysql \
    --restart on-failure:5 \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sup3rsecr3t \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=portal \
    -e MYSQL_USER=admin \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secr3t \
    --mount type=volume,source=tyk-portal-mysql-data,target=/var/lib/mysql \
    --network tyk-portal \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    mysql:5.7 --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci --sql-mode=ALLOW_INVALID_DATES
    ```
  <Info>
	The above MySQL configuration is an example. You can customize deployment of your MySQL instance.
	Please refer to the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-applications.html) for further guidance.

#### Using Sqlite

<Warning>
SQLite is useful for quick deployment and testing, however we don’t recommend using it in production.
</Warning>

<Info>
Tyk no longer supports SQLite as of Tyk 5.7.0. To avoid disruption, please transition to [PostgreSQL](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#postgresql), [MongoDB](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#mongodb), or one of the listed compatible alternatives.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a volume for the portal’s database">
	To start with, you need to create a single volume for sqlite:
	```console
	mkdir -p /tmp/portal/db
	chmod -R o+x,o+w /tmp/portal
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an environment variables file">

	This command will launch the portal on localhost at port 3001. Now, you can bootstrap the portal and start managing your API products.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap the portal">
	Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it’s the first you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up">
	If you want to clean up your environment or start the installation process from scratch, execute the following commands to stop and remove the portal container:
	```console
	docker-compose down
	docker-compose down
	```
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Using Sqlite

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an environment variables file for configuring the portal and the database">
	Creating an environment file to specify settings for the portal is the next step. This is optional, as you can alternatively specify all the variables using the -e option when starting your deployment.
	Here is an example of a sample environment file. For a comprehensive reference of environment variables, please refer to the \[configuration section(//tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration/)\] in the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal documentation.
	```ini
	PORTAL_HOSTPORT=3001
	PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT=sqlite3
	PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING=db/portal.db
	PORTAL_DATABASE_ENABLELOGS=false
	PORTAL_THEMING_THEME=default
	PORTAL_THEMING_PATH=./themes
	PORTAL_LICENSEKEY=<your-license-here>
	PORTAL_STORAGE=db
	```
	Once you have completed this step, you are ready to launch the portal application with SQLite via Docker Compose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a docker-compose file">
	Before launching the portal using docker-compose, you will need to create a `docker-compose.yaml` file. An example of the portal’s docker-compose file is provided below, which you can use as a starting point and further customize to meet your specific requirements.
	```yaml
	version: '3.6'
	services:
	tyk-portal:
	    image: tykio/portal:<tag>
	    volumes:
	    - /tmp/portal/db:/opt/portal/db
	    ports:
	    - 3001:3001
	    environment:
	    - PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT=${PORTAL_DATABASE_DIALECT}
	    - PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING=${PORTAL_DATABASE_CONNECTIONSTRING}
	    - PORTAL_THEMING_THEME=${PORTAL_THEMING_THEME}
	    - PORTAL_THEMING_PATH=${PORTAL_THEMING_PATH}
	    - PORTAL_LICENSEKEY=${PORTAL_LICENSEKEY}
	    - PORTAL_STORAGE=${PORTAL_STORAGE}
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pull and launch the portal container using docker-compose">
	To launch the portal using docker-compose, execute the command provided below.
	```console
	docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
	docker-compose --env-file .env up -d
	```
	This command will launch the portal on localhost at port 3001. Now, you can bootstrap the portal and start managing your API products.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap the portal">
	Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it’s the first time you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean up">
	If you want to clean up your environment or start the installation process from scratch, execute the following commands to stop and stop and remove the portal container:
	```console
	docker-compose down
	docker-compose down
	```
	Since the SQLite data is persisted in the mounted volume (`/tmp/portal/db` in the above example), to completely erase the deployment, you will also need to delete it for a complete clean-up:
	```console
	rm -rf /tmp/portal/db
	rm -rf /tmp/portal/db
	```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Kubernetes

#### Using New Helm Chart

There are two ways to install Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal. You can enable `global.components.devPortal` during Tyk Self-Managed deployment by following the [Tyk Self-Managed installation instruction](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-charts/tyk-stack-chart/) using our `tyk-stack` umbrella chart. It will install Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal together with Tyk Gateway and Dashboard in the same namespace.

Alternatively, you can install Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal as standalone component using our `tyk-dev-portal` chart. This page provides a clear and concise, step-by-step guide for installing the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal as standalone component using the new helm chart.

To install the portal using helm charts, you need to take the following steps:

- Create the `tyk-dev-portal-conf` secret
- Specify config settings for the portal in `values.yaml`
- Launch the portal using the helm chart
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the `tyk-dev-portal-conf` secret">
	Make sure the `tyk-dev-portal-conf` secret exists in your namespace. This secret will automatically be generated if Tyk Dashboard instance was bootstrapped with [tyk-boostrap](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/tyk-helm/tyk-bootstrap) component chart and `bootstrap.devPortal` was set to `true` in the `values.yaml`.
	If the secret does not exist, you can create it by running the following command.
	```bash
	kubectl create secret generic tyk-dev-portal-conf -n ${NAMESPACE} \
	--from-literal=TYK_ORG=${TYK_ORG} \
	--from-literal=TYK_AUTH=${TYK_AUTH}
	```
	The fields `TYK_ORG` and `TYK_AUTH` are the Tyk Dashboard *Organization ID* and the Tyk Dashboard API *Access Credentials* respectively. These can be obtained under your profile in the Tyk Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Config settings">
	You must set the following values in the `values.yaml` or with `--set {field-name}={field-value}` using the helm upgrade command:
	| Field Name | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| `global.adminUser.email` and `global.adminUser.password` | Set portal admin username and email for bootstrapping |
	| `global.secrets.devPortal` | Enable portal bootstrapping by providing secret name |
	| `license` | Tyk license key for your portal installation |
	| `storage.type` | Portal storage type, e.g. *fs*, *s3* and *db* |
	| `image.tag` | Enterprise Portal version. You can get the latest version image tag from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tykio/portal/tags) |
	| `database.dialect` | Portal database dialect, e.g. *mysql*, *postgres* and *sqlite3* |
	| `database.connectionString` | Connection string to the Portal’s database, e.g. for the *mysql* dialect: `admin:secr3t@tcp(tyk-portal-mysql:3306)/portal?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true` |
	In addition to `values.yaml`, you can also define the environment variables described in the [configuration section](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration/) to further customize your portal deployment. These environment variables can also be listed as a name value list under the `extraEnvs` section of the helm chart.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the portal using the helm chart">
	Run the following command to update your infrastructure and install the developer portal:
	```bash
	helm install tyk-dev-portal tyk-helm/tyk-dev-portal -f values.yaml -n tyk
	```
  </Step>
</Steps>

###### Configuration

Please refer to this [guide](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-charts/tyk-stack-chart/) for an explanation of all configuration options.

> **Note**: Helm chart supports Enterprise Portal v1.2.0+.

#### Using Legacy Helm Chart

<Note>
It is recommended to use new helm charts instead of legacy charts. Guide for new charts can be found [here](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#using-new-helm-chart)
</Note>

To install the portal using helm charts, you need to take the following steps:

- Create the `tyk-enterprise-portal-conf` secret
- Specify config settings for the portal in `values.yaml`
- Launch the portal using the helm chart

This guide provides a clear and concise, step-by-step recipe for installing the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal using helm charts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the `tyk-enterprise-portal-conf` secret">
	Make sure the `tyk-enterprise-portal-conf` secret exists in your namespace. This secret will automatically be generated during the Tyk Dashboard bootstrap if the `dash.enterprisePortalSecret` value is set to `true` in the `values.yaml`.
	If the secret does not exist, you can create it by running the following command.
	```bash
	kubectl create secret generic tyk-enterprise-portal-conf -n ${NAMESPACE} \
	--from-literal=TYK_ORG=${TYK_ORG} \
	--from-literal=TYK_AUTH=${TYK_AUTH}
	```
	Where `TYK_ORG` and `TYK_AUTH` are the Tyk Dashboard Organization ID and the Tyk Dashboard API Access Credentials respectively. Which can be obtained under your profile in the Tyk Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Config settings">
	```
	**Note**
	Tyk no longer supports SQLite as of Tyk 5.7.0. To avoid disruption, please transition to [PostgreSQL](//tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#postgresql), [MongoDB](//tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#mongodb), or one of the listed compatible alternatives.
	```
	You must set the following values in the `values.yaml` or with `--set {field-name}={field-value}` with the helm upgrade command:
	| Field Name | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| `enterprisePortal.enabled` | Enable Portal installation |
	| `enterprisePortal.bootstrap` | Enable Portal bootstrapping |
	| `enterprisePortal.license` | Tyk license key for your portal installation |
	| `enterprisePortal.storage.type` | Portal database dialect, e.g *mysql*, *postgres* or *sqlite3* |
	| `enterprisePortal.storage.connectionString` | Connection string to the Portal’s database, e.g for the mysql dialect: `admin:secr3t@tcp(tyk-portal-mysql:3306)/portal?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true` |
	In addition to values.yaml, you can also define the environment variables described in the [configuration section](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration/) to further customize your portal deployment. These environment variables can also be listed as a name value list under the `extraEnvs` section of the helm chart.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the portal using the helm chart">
	Run the following command to update your infrastructure and install the developer portal:
	```bash
	helm upgrade tyk-pro tyk-helm/tyk-pro -f values.yaml -n tyk
	```
  </Step>
</Steps>

In case this is the first time you are launching the portal, it will be necessary to bootstrap it before you can use it. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [bootstrapping documentation](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal).

<Note>
Helm chart supports Enterprise Portal v1.2.0+.
</Note>

### Red Hat (RHEL / CentOS)

This guide provides a step-by-step recipe for launching the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal using an RPM package in Red Hat environment (RHEL / CentOS).

<Note>
This document is just an example. Customize all fields, including the username, password, root password, database name and more.

Be sure to update the connection DSN in the env-file accordingly.
</Note>

**Prerequisites**

To successfully install the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal using RPM, your environment should satisfy the following requirements:

- Connectivity to [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/). If your environment doesn’t have connectivity to packagecloud, you will need to download the portal package and copy it to the target host.
- RPM Package Manager should be installed on the host machine.

**Steps for Installation**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the portal package">
	To start with, you need to download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/). To keep things organized, first create a directory where all installation assets (packages and config files) will be stored:
	```console
	mkdir ~/portal-install
	cd ~/portal-install
	```
	Next, download the portal package from [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable) by executing the command below. Ensure to replace package-version with actual package version e.g. [https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/el/8/portal-1.7.0-1.x86\_64.rpm/download.rpm?distro\_version\_id=205](https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/el/8/portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm/download.rpm?distro_version_id=205) for the portal v1.7.0 for x86\_64.
	```console
	wget --content-disposition "https://packagecloud.io/tyk/portal-unstable/packages/<package-version>"
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the portal package">
	Once the package is downloaded, you need to install using RPM. Execute the below command to so. Once again, ensure to replace `portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm` with an actual filename of the package you have downloaded on the previous step.
	```console
	sudo rpm -i portal-1.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update the configuration file with your license">
	```
	**Note**
	Tyk no longer supports SQLite as of Tyk 5.7.0. To avoid disruption, please transition to [PostgreSQL](//tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#postgresql), [MongoDB](//tyk.io/docs/tyk-self-managed/#mongodb), or one of the listed compatible alternatives.
	```
	Before starting the portal service, you need to configure the portal. Once the rpm package has been installed, the portal configuration file will be located in `/opt/portal/portal.conf`. Initially, the config file is filled with the default values. The minimal configuration change to start the portal is to add the `LicenseKey` property to the config file. The below sample configuration will start the portal on portal 3001 with SQLite as a database, no TLS enabled, and all CMS assets (images, theme files, etc.) are stored in the filesystem. You can, however, customize the provided example and make more suitable for your need using the [configuration](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration/) reference.
	```json
	{
	"HostPort": 3001,
	"LicenseKey": "<your-license-here>",
	"Database": {
	    "Dialect": "sqlite3",
	    "ConnectionString": "portal.db",
	    "EnableLogs": false
	},
	"Blog": {
	    "Enable": true
	},
	"Site": {
	    "Enable": true
	},
	"Forms": {
	    "Enable": false
	},
	"StoreSessionName": "portal-store-session-name",
	"PortalAPISecret": "123456",
	"Storage": "fs",
	"S3": {
	    "AccessKey": "your-access-key-here",
	    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key-here",
	    "Region": "s3-region",
	    "Endpoint": "if-any",
	    "Bucket": "your-bucket-here",
	    "ACL": "",
	    "PresignURLs": true
	},
	"TLSConfig": {
	    "Enable": false,
	    "InsecureSkipVerify": false,
	    "Certificates":[
	    {
	        "Name": "localhost",
	        "CertFile": "portal.crt",
	        "KeyFile": "portal.key"
	    }
	    ]
	}
	}
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the portal service">
	Now when the portal package is installed and the configuration is updated, it is time to start the portal by executing the following command:
	```console
	sudo systemctl start portal.service
	```
	To check status and log of the portal execute the following command:
	```console
	systemctl status portal.service
	```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bootstrap the portal">
	Now the portal is running on port 3001, but it needs to be bootstrapped by providing credentials for the super admin user since it’s the first you are launching it. Follow the [bootstrapping](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/install/#bootstrapping-enterprise-developer-portal) section of the documentation to bootstrap the portal via the UI or the admin API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bootstrapping Enterprise Developer Portal

When launching the Tyk Enterprise Developer portal for the first time, it starts in a special bootstrap mode, which is required to create the first admin user who will act as the super admin. After launching the portal, you can bootstrap it using either the portal UI or the bootstrap API.

This section explains how to bootstrap the portal using both the portal UI and the bootstrap API.

### Bootstrapping the Portal via the UI

After launching the portal for the first time, you can use its UI to bootstrap it. The portal will display a form that allows you to create a super admin user and set their password.

Navigate to the portal UI in your browser to start bootstrapping the portal. You should see the following:

<Frame>
![Portal bootstrap UI](https://tyk.io/docs/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/portal-bootstrap-ui-empty_hu_bffc2877980bce9d.webp)
</Frame>

Enter the admin email, password, first name, and last name. Then click on the `Register to Developer portal` button to complete the bootstrapping process.

The bootstrap process should take no longer than a couple of seconds, so almost instantly the portal will display the following page, which confirms the successful bootstrap.

<Frame>
![Successful bootstrapping](https://tyk.io/docs/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/portal-bootstrap-successful_hu_94b2be863fc51b46.webp)
</Frame>

Click on the `Login` button to proceed to the login page, where you can use the newly created super admin credentials to log in to the portal.

### Bootstrapping the Portal via the API

The second approach to bootstrap the portal is through the bootstrap API, which allows you to programmatically bootstrap the portal.

To bootstrap the portal via an API call, call the bootstrap API:

```shell
curl --location 'http://<your-portal-host>:<your-portal-port>/portal-api/bootstrap' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username":"super-admin@tyk.io",
    "password": "tyk123",
    "first_name":"John",
    "last_name":"Doe"
}'
```

The bootstrap API accepts the following parameters:

- **username** - email of the super admin, it is also used as their login
- **password** - the super admin login password
- **first\_name** - first name of the super admin
- **last\_name** - first name of the super admin

The bootstrap process should take no longer than a couple of seconds. You will receive the following response as a confirmation of the successful bootstrapping:

```json
{
    "code": "OK",
    "message": "Bootstrapped user successfully",
    "data": {
        "api_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJQcm92aWRlciI6Im5vbmUiLCJVc2VySUQiOiIkMmEkMTAkREF0czZhZTY0ZEZXSkFTbnR2OS8yLmMxcS91VTFhbTRGYk53RVJhTE1Ed2c0NHFsSXJnMkMifQ.ExTNl6UvjQA6WqrPE-7OkSNCBBixc2NGMnh3dnlk5Nw"
    }
}
```

<Info>
### Take a note of the `api_token` field

You will need this to call other Portal APIs.
</Info>

### Login as the super admin

After you have bootstrapped the portal, either via the UI or the bootstrap API, you can use the super admin’s login credentials to log in to the portal. Open the portal UI in your browser and click on the ‘Login’ button to open the login page.

<Frame>
![Open the login page](https://tyk.io/docs/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/navigate-to-the-login-page_hu_38d2a4538d3f74c6.webp)
</Frame>


On the login page, enter the super admin credentials for logging into the portal:

![Open the login page](https://tyk.io/docs/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/login-page-after-bootstrapping_hu_123b3c65c81f8514.webp)
</Frame>


<Info>
**Congratulations!**

Now you have a fully functional portal.
</Info>


You can continue configuring and customizing it either via the UI or the portal admin API. Please refer to [the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal Concepts section](https://tyk.io/docs/portal/overview/#developer-portal-concepts) for further guidance.
