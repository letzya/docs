### AI Management for Platform Teams

We are excited to introduce our product for AI management - Tyk AI Studio

Tyk AI Studio enables platform teams to:

- Centralise access credentials to AI vendors, be that commercial offerings or in-house ones
- Log and measure how AI is being used internally
- Build and release Chatbots for internal Slack channels
- Ingest data into a knowledge corpus, with siloed access settings
- Build AI functions (Smart Functions) as a Service for common, single-task automations (e.g. summarise this article) or modulated pass-through to upstream AIâ€™s with query inspection to provide context-aware access control.
- Script complex multi-modal assistants that can selectively determine which AI vendor, model, and data set to use depending on the nature of the user input
- Full-blown RBAC to democratise access to LLMs without impinging on security obligations
