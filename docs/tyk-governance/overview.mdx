## Overview

It solves the challenge of fragmented API management by providing a centralized approach to governance, regardless of where your APIs are hosted or which technologies they use.

In todayâ€™s complex API ecosystems, organizations struggle with inconsistent standards, security vulnerabilities, and compliance gaps across different API platforms. Tyk Governance bridges these gaps by creating a unified governance layer that works seamlessly with Tyk and extends to third-party API platforms, such as AWS API Gateway.

## Key Benefits

- **Universal Governance** - Define and enforce consistent policies across multiple API platforms and styles (REST, GraphQL, event-driven) from a single control plane
- **Reduced Duplication** - Identify redundant or shadow APIs across different departments, reducing maintenance costs and security risks
- **Early Feedback** - Catch governance violations during design and development, not after deployment, reducing rework by up to 60%
- **Collaborative Improvement** - Enable teams to work together with shared visibility and clear ownership of APIs across the organization
- **Measurable API Maturity** - Track and improve API quality with quantifiable metrics across technical excellence, business impact, and developer experience

## Who Should Use Tyk Governance

Tyk Governance transforms API governance from a fragmented, post-deployment concern into a proactive, continuous, and scalable process across your entire API ecosystem.

### Enterprise Architects & Security Leads

Enterprise architects and security leads use Tyk Governance to establish organization-wide standards and ensure strategic alignment of the API program. They benefit from:

- Centralized visibility across all API platforms
- Comprehensive compliance reporting
- The ability to define tiered governance policies based on API criticality

**Example:** An enterprise architect at a financial services company uses Tyk Governance to ensure all customer-facing APIs comply with security and regulatory requirements, while allowing internal APIs to follow a lighter governance model.

### Platform Engineers

Platform engineers leverage Tyk Governance to build and maintain internal developer platforms that streamline API development. They value:

- Seamless integration of governance into CI/CD pipelines
- Self-service tools that empower developers
- Unified monitoring across environments

**Example:** A platform engineer integrates Tyk Governance into Tyk Dashboard and other API platforms, providing API templates that automatically incorporate security best practices and compliance requirements.

### API Developers

API developers rely on Tyk Governance to design and implement APIs that meet organizational standards from day one. They appreciate:

- Clear guidance on governance requirements
- Real-time feedback during development
- Reduced rework and faster release cycles

**Example:** An API developer receives immediate feedback that their new payment API is missing required rate-limiting policies, allowing them to fix the issue before submitting for review.
