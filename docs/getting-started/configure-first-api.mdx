description: Configure your first API on Tyk Cloud
---


## Overview
This guide helps you get started with Tyk by covering the basics:

- **Set up your API**: Create and configure a new API in the Tyk Dashboard.
- **Create API keys**: Generate API keys and assign them to your APIs for secure access.
- **Monitor API performance**: Track traffic, logs, and performance analytics.

Follow these steps to quickly and easily create and manage your APIs with Tyk.

## Prerequisites

To start quickly, we'll use Tyk Cloud in this guide.

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [A Tyk Cloud account](https://tyk.io/sign-up/#cloud).
- Admin access to the Tyk Dashboard.
- (optional) A backend service that your API will proxy (e.g., a RESTful API) - or you can use the httpbin service.
