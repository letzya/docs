The **Model Prices View** allows administrators to manage and track the cost associated with Large Language Model (LLM) usage. This section is essential for monitoring expenses and setting pricing for LLM use within the AI Gateway and Chat Room features. Below is a detailed breakdown of the table and its features:

---

#### **Table Overview**
The table displays the following columns:

1. **Model Name**:
   - The name of the LLM model for which pricing is defined (e.g., `claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620`, `gpt-4o`).

2. **Vendor**:
   - The organization providing the LLM (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI).

3. **Cost per Input Token**:
   - The price charged for each input token processed by the LLM.
   - Example: A value of `0.000001` represents the cost in the specified currency per token.

4. **Cost per Output Token**:
   - The price charged for each output token generated by the LLM.
   - Example: A value of `0.000015` reflects the token generation cost in the specified currency.

5. **Currency**:
   - The currency in which the model's pricing is defined (e.g., USD).

6. **Actions**:
   - A menu (three-dot icon) with quick actions for each model, allowing administrators to:
     - Edit the pricing.
     - Delete the pricing configuration.

#### **Features**

1. **Add Model Price Button**:
   - A green button labeled **+ ADD MODEL PRICE**, located in the top-right corner. Clicking this button opens a form to configure the pricing for a new LLM model.

2. **Pagination Dropdown**:
   - Located at the bottom-left corner, this control allows users to adjust how many pricing entries are displayed per page.

---

#### **Use Cases**
- **AI Gateway Tracking**:
   - Ensures that token-based costs for API calls through the AI Gateway are accurately logged and monitored.

- **Chat Room Cost Analysis**:
   - Tracks and evaluates expenses associated with user interactions in the Chat Room feature.

#### **Quick Insights**
This section simplifies the process of tracking and updating LLM pricing, ensuring transparency and control over usage costs. The ability to edit or add prices directly from this interface provides flexibility for managing vendor costs dynamically as new models or pricing structures are introduced.

### Edit/Create Model Prices

The **Edit/Create Model Price Form** allows administrators to define or update the cost structure for a specific Large Language Model (LLM). The pricing information configured here is used for cost tracking and billing purposes and must align with the model names used in API calls or the model settings screen.
