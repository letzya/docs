The **LLMs View** provides administrators with an overview of the Large Language Model (LLM) vendors integrated into the portal. This section allows for managing the LLMs available for use in Chat Room features and the AI Gateway. Below is a breakdown of the features and data displayed:

---

#### **Table Overview**
The table displays the following columns:

1. **Name**:
   The name of the LLM vendor or model (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI GPT-4o, VLLM).

2. **Short Description**:
   A brief overview of the LLM, highlighting its features, strengths, and recommended use cases.
   - Example: "Anthropic's flagship LLM: Claude is known for its excellent support for code-related tasks and code generation."

3. **Vendor**:
   The name of the LLM vendor providing the model (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI).

4. **Privacy Level**:
   Indicates the model's privacy capability. Privacy levels define how data is protected by controlling LLM access based on its sensitivity. LLM providers with lower privacy levels can't access higher-level data sources and tools, ensuring secure and appropriate data handling.
   
   The system works with 4 privacy levels from low to high:
   - Public – Safe to share (e.g., blogs, press releases).
   - Internal – Company-only info (e.g., reports, policies).
   - Confidential – Sensitive business data (e.g., financials, strategies).
   - Restricted (PII) – Personal data (e.g., names, emails, customer info).

5. **Proxied**:
   A status indicator showing whether the LLM is proxied through the AI Gateway for added security and control.
   - **Green dot**: Proxied.
   - **Red dot**: Not proxied.

6. **Actions**:
   A menu (three-dot icon) that allows administrators to perform specific actions on the LLM, such as editing its details, managing configurations, or removing it from the portal.

---

#### **Features**
1. **Add LLM Button**:
   A green button in the top-right corner labeled **+ ADD LLM**. Clicking this button opens a form to integrate a new LLM vendor or model into the portal.

2. **Pagination Dropdown**:
   Found at the bottom-left corner, this dropdown allows users to control how many LLMs are displayed per page.

---

#### **Use Cases**
- **Chat Room Features**:
   LLMs integrated into the Chat Room provide users with easy access to conversational AI for various purposes, such as general inquiries or task automation.

- **AI Gateway**:
   LLMs configured for the AI Gateway are used to route requests securely, offering fine-grained access control and privacy protections for API calls.
