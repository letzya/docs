The **Apps View** is used to manage user-created applications that interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) and data sources via the Tyk AI Gateway. These apps provide a mechanism for users to define and encapsulate the functionality and resources they need for API interactions. Below is a detailed overview of the Apps View and its functionality.

---

#### **Apps List Overview**

1. **Name**:
   - The name of the application created by the user (e.g., `My New App`, `Jira Task Refiner`).

2. **Description**:
   - A brief explanation of the app's purpose or functionality (e.g., "Experiment to refine tasks for Jira").

3. **User**:
   - The name of the user who created or owns the application.

4. **Actions**:
   - A menu (three-dot icon) for performing app-related actions, such as:
     - Viewing app details.
     - Editing the app configuration.
     - Deleting the app.

---

#### **Features**

1. **Add App Button**:
   - A green button labeled **+ ADD APP**, located in the top-right corner. Clicking this button opens a form for creating a new app.

2. **Pagination Control**:
   - Located at the bottom-left, this dropdown allows administrators to adjust the number of apps displayed per page.

---

#### **Purpose of Apps**

1. **Encapsulation of Resources**:
   - Apps bundle together the LLMs, tools, and data sources a user needs to access through the AI Gateway.

2. **RESTful Access via Credentials**:
   - Each app is linked to a set of credentials that users can use to authenticate API requests.
   - Credentials must be activated by an administrator after an app is submitted.

3. **Integration with Upstream LLMs**:
   - Apps allow users to access LLMs through the following methods:
     - **Vendor-Native SDKs**: Direct interaction with the upstream provider's SDK.
     - **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Requests translated into a standardized API format.

4. **Centralized Administration**:
   - Administrators can manage all user-created apps, ensuring proper governance and access control.

---

#### **Example Workflow**

1. **App Creation**:
   - A user creates an app and specifies the LLMs, tools, and data sources required for their use case.

2. **Credential Activation**:
   - Once the app is submitted, an admin reviews and activates the app's credentials, enabling the app to interact with the AI Gateway.

3. **API Integration**:
   - The user integrates their app with their systems using the provided credentials and API endpoints.

4. **Real-Time Usage**:
   - The app facilitates RESTful communication with the specified resources via the AI Gateway.

---

#### **Benefits**

1. **Streamlined Access**:
   - Users can consolidate all the resources they need into a single app, simplifying integration workflows.

2. **Governance and Security**:
   - Admin-controlled credential activation ensures that only approved apps can access the AI Gateway.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Support for both vendor-native SDKs and OpenAI-compatible APIs allows users to integrate apps into diverse environments.

4. **Centralized Management**:
   - Admins can oversee all user-created apps, ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

The **App Edit View** is a critical feature for managing user-created apps in the Tyk AI Studio, providing administrators with full control over app configuration, approval, and access management.

### Privacy Level Validation

When creating or updating an app, the system validates that the privacy levels of selected datasources are not higher than the privacy levels of selected LLMs. This ensures data governance and prevents sensitive data from being exposed to less secure LLMs.

Privacy levels define how data is protected by controlling LLM access based on its sensitivity. LLM providers with lower privacy levels can't access higher-level data sources and tools, ensuring secure and appropriate data handling.

The system works with 4 privacy levels from low to high:
- Public – Safe to share (e.g., blogs, press releases).
- Internal – Company-only info (e.g., reports, policies).
- Confidential – Sensitive business data (e.g., financials, strategies).
- Restricted (PII) – Personal data (e.g., names, emails, customer info).

If you attempt to create or update an app with datasources that have higher privacy requirements (levels) than the selected LLMs, you'll receive an error message: "Datasources have higher privacy requirements than the selected LLMs. Please select LLMs with equal or higher privacy levels."

To resolve this issue, either:
1. Select LLMs with higher privacy levels that match or exceed your datasource requirements
2. Use datasources with lower privacy requirements that are compatible with your selected LLMs
