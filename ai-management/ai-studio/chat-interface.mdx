# Chat Interface

Tyk AI Studio's Chat Interface provides a secure and interactive environment for users to engage with Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging integrated tools and data sources. It serves as the primary front-end for conversational AI interactions within the platform.

## Purpose

The main goals of the Chat Interface are:

*   **User-Friendly Interaction:** Offer an intuitive web-based chat experience for users of all technical levels.
*   **Unified Access:** Provide a single point of access to various configured LLMs, Tools, and Data Sources.
*   **Context Management:** Maintain conversation history and manage context, including system prompts and retrieved data (RAG).
*   **Secure & Governed:** Enforce access controls based on user groups and apply configured Filters.

## Key Features

*   **Chat Sessions:** Each conversation happens within a session, preserving history and context.
*   **Streaming Responses:** LLM responses are streamed back to the user for a more interactive feel.
*   **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly uses configured [Tools](/ai-management/ai-studio/tools) when the LLM determines they are necessary to fulfill a user's request. The available tools depend on the Chat Experience configuration and the user's group permissions.
*   **Data Source (RAG) Integration:** Can automatically query configured [Data Sources](/ai-management/ai-studio/datasources-rag) to retrieve relevant information (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to enhance LLM responses. The available data sources depend on the Chat Experience configuration and the user's group permissions.
*   **System Prompts:** Administrators can define specific system prompts for different Chat Experiences to guide the LLM's persona, tone, and behavior.
*   **History:** Users can view their past chat sessions.
*   **File Upload (Context):** Users might be able to upload files directly within a chat to provide temporary context for the LLM (depending on configuration).
*   **Access Control:** Users only see and can interact with Chat Experiences assigned to their [Groups](/ai-management/ai-studio/user-management).

## Using the Chat Interface

Users access the Chat Interface through the Tyk AI Studio web UI.

1.  **Select Chat Experience:** Users choose from a list of available Chat Experiences (pre-configured chat environments) they have access to.
2.  **Interact:** Users type their prompts or questions.
3.  **Receive Responses:** The LLM processes the request, potentially using tools or data sources behind the scenes, and streams the response back.

## Configuration (Admin)

Administrators configure the available "Chat Experiences" (formerly known as Chat Rooms) via the UI or API. Configuration involves:

*   **Naming:** Giving the Chat Experience a descriptive name.
*   **Assigning LLM:** Linking to a specific [LLM Configuration](/ai-management/ai-studio/llm-management).
*   **Enabling Tools:** Selecting which [Tool Catalogues](/ai-management/ai-studio/tools) are available.
*   **Enabling Data Sources:** Selecting which [Data Source Catalogues](/ai-management/ai-studio/datasources-rag) are available.
*   **Setting System Prompt:** Defining the guiding prompt for the LLM.
*   **Applying Filters:** Associating specific [Filters](/ai-management/ai-studio/filters) for governance.
*   **Assigning Groups:** Determining which [User Groups](/ai-management/ai-studio/user-management) can access this Chat Experience.
*   **Enabling/Disabling Features:** Toggling features like file uploads or direct tool usage.

## API Access

Beyond the UI, Tyk AI Studio provides APIs (`/api/v1/chat/...`) for programmatic interaction with the chat system, allowing developers to build custom applications or integrations that leverage the configured Chat Experiences.

This comprehensive system provides a powerful yet controlled way for users to interact with AI capabilities managed by Tyk AI Studio.
