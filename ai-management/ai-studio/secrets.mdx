Tyk AI Studio provides a secure mechanism for storing and managing sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, authentication tokens, or other credentials required by various platform configurations.

## Purpose

The Secrets Management system aims to:

*   **Prevent Exposure:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive values directly in configuration files or UI fields.
*   **Centralize Management:** Provide a single place to manage and update credentials.
*   **Enhance Security:** Store sensitive data encrypted at rest.

## Core Concepts

*   **Secret:** A named key-value pair where the 'key' is the **Variable Name** used for reference, and the 'value' is the actual sensitive data (e.g., an API key string).

*   **Encryption:**
    *   Secret values are **encrypted at rest** within Tyk AI Studio's storage.
    *   The encryption and decryption process relies on a key derived from the **`TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY` environment variable** set when running the Tyk AI Studio instance.
    *   **CRITICAL:** The `TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY` must be kept confidential and managed securely. Loss of this key will render existing secrets unusable. Changing the key will require re-entering all secrets.

*   **Reference Syntax:** Secrets are referenced within configuration fields (like API key fields in LLM or Tool setups) using a specific syntax:
    ```
    $SECRET/VariableName
    ```
    Replace `VariableName` with the exact name given to the secret when it was created (e.g., `$SECRET/OPENAI_API_KEY`, `$SECRET/JIRA_AUTH_TOKEN`).

*   **Runtime Resolution:** When a configuration uses a field containing a secret reference (e.g., `$SECRET/MY_KEY`):
    1.  The configuration itself stores the `$SECRET/MY_KEY` string, *not* the actual secret value.
    2.  Only when the system needs the actual value at runtime (e.g., the [Proxy](/ai-management/ai-studio/proxy) preparing a request for an LLM, or a [Tool](/ai-management/ai-studio/tools) calling its external API), Tyk AI Studio retrieves the encrypted secret value, decrypts it using the `TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY`, and injects the plain text value into the operation.
    3.  The decrypted value is typically used immediately and not persisted further.

## Creating & Managing Secrets (Admin)

Administrators manage secrets via the Tyk AI Studio UI or API:

1.  Navigate to the Secrets management section.
2.  Create a new secret by providing:
    *   **Variable Name:** A unique identifier (letters, numbers, underscores) used in the `$SECRET/VariableName` reference.
    *   **Secret Value:** The actual sensitive string (e.g., `sk-abc123xyz...`).
3.  Save the secret. It is immediately encrypted and stored.

Secrets can be updated or deleted as needed. Updating a secret value will automatically apply the new value wherever the `$SECRET/VariableName` reference is used, without needing to modify the configurations themselves.

## Usage Examples

Secrets are commonly used in:

*   **[LLM Configurations](/ai-management/ai-studio/llm-management):** Storing API keys for providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI, etc.
    *   *Example:* In the API Key field for an OpenAI configuration: `$SECRET/OPENAI_API_KEY`
*   **[Tool Configurations](/ai-management/ai-studio/tools):** Storing API keys, authentication tokens (Bearer, Basic Auth), or other credentials needed to interact with the external API the tool represents.
    *   *Example:* In a field for a custom header for a JIRA tool: `Authorization: Basic $SECRET/JIRA_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
*   **[Data Source Configurations](/ai-management/ai-studio/datasources-rag):** Storing API keys or connection credentials for vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) or embedding service providers.
    *   *Example:* In the API Key field for a Pinecone vector store: `$SECRET/PINECONE_API_KEY`

## Security Considerations

*   **Protect `TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY`:** This is the master key for secrets. Treat it with the same level of security as database passwords or root credentials. Use environment variable management best practices.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant administrative access (which includes secrets management) only to trusted users.
*   **Regular Rotation:** Consider policies for regularly rotating sensitive credentials by updating the Secret Value in Tyk AI Studio.
