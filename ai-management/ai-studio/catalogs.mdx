The **Catalogs View** provides administrators with a centralized interface to group and manage related resources such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Data Sources, and Tools. By organizing these resources into catalogs, administrators can efficiently manage access control and simplify the assignment of resources to user groups.

   - Access to these resources is controlled by assigning catalogs to specific user groups.

2. **Use Cases**:
   - Simplify resource management by categorizing related LLMs, Data Sources, or Tools into a single catalog.
   - Apply consistent access control policies by assigning catalogs to groups.
   - Manage large quantities of resources efficiently in a growing environment.
