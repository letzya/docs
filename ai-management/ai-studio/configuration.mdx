This guide covers the essential first steps to take within the Tyk AI Studio UI after successfully deploying the platform using the [Installation Guide](/ai-management/ai-studio/deployment-helm-k8s).

## 1. First Login

1.  **Access the UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to the `SITE_URL` (or the Ingress host configured for `app.yourdomain.com`) specified during deployment.
2.  **Admin Credentials:** Log in using the initial administrator credentials. This is typically:
    *   **Email:** The `ADMIN_EMAIL` configured during deployment (e.g., `admin@yourdomain.com`).
    *   **Password:** Check the deployment logs or default configuration for the initial admin password setup. You may be required to set a new password upon first login.

## 2. Configure Your First LLM

One of the most common initial steps is connecting Tyk AI Studio to an LLM provider.

1.  **Navigate to LLM Management:** In the admin UI sidebar, find the section for LLM Management (or similar) and select it.
2.  **Add LLM Configuration:** Click the button to add a new LLM Configuration.
3.  **Select Provider:** Choose the LLM provider you want to connect (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI).
4.  **Enter Details:**
    *   **Configuration Name:** Give it a recognizable name (e.g., `OpenAI-GPT-4o`).
    *   **Model Name(s):** Specify the exact model identifier(s) provided by the vendor (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`).
    *   **API Key (Using Secrets):**
        *   **IMPORTANT:** Do *not* paste your API key directly here. Instead, use [Secrets Management](/ai-management/ai-studio/secrets).
        *   If you haven't already, go to the **Secrets** section in the admin UI and create a new secret:
            *   **Variable Name:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or similar)
            *   **Secret Value:** Paste your actual OpenAI API key here.
            *   Save the secret.
        *   Return to the LLM Configuration screen.
        *   In the API Key field, enter the secret reference: `$SECRET/OPENAI_API_KEY` (using the exact Variable Name you created).
    *   **Other Parameters:** Configure any other provider-specific settings (e.g., Base URL for Azure/custom endpoints, default temperature, etc.).
5.  **Save:** Save the LLM configuration.

This LLM is now available for use within Tyk AI Studio, subject to [User/Group permissions](/ai-management/ai-studio/user-management).

For more details, see the [LLM Management](/ai-management/ai-studio/llm-management) documentation.

## 3. Verify Core System Settings

While most core settings are configured during deployment, you can usually review them within the administration UI:

*   **Site URL:** Check that the base URL for accessing the portal is correct.
*   **Email Configuration:** If using features like user invites or notifications, ensure SMTP settings are correctly configured and test email delivery if possible ([Notifications](/ai-management/ai-studio/notifications)).

## 4. Configuration Reference (Deployment)

Remember that fundamental system parameters are typically set via environment variables or Helm values *during deployment*. This includes:

*   Database Connection (`DATABASE_TYPE`, `DATABASE_URL`)
*   License Key (`TYK_AI_LICENSE`)
*   Secrets Encryption Key (`TYK_AI_SECRET_KEY`)
*   Base URL (`SITE_URL`)
*   Email Server Settings (`SMTP_*`, `FROM_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`)
*   Registration Settings (`ALLOW_REGISTRATIONS`, `FILTER_SIGNUP_DOMAINS`)

Refer to the **Configuration Options** detailed within the [Installation Guide](/ai-management/ai-studio/deployment-helm-k8s) for specifics on setting these values during the deployment process.

## Next Steps

With the initial configuration complete, you can now:

*   Explore [User Management](/ai-management/ai-studio/user-management) to create users and groups.
*   Set up [Tools](/ai-management/ai-studio/tools) for external API integration.
*   Configure [Data Sources](/ai-management/ai-studio/datasources-rag) for RAG.
*   Define [Filters](/ai-management/ai-studio/filters) for custom request/response logic.
*   Try out the [Chat Interface](/ai-management/ai-studio/chat-interface).
