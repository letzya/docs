As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into enterprise systems, organisations need structured, secure, and governed approaches to manage AI capabilities effectively. Tyk's AI management solutions are designed to help enterprises integrate, control, and scale AI applications while maintaining compliance and security.

## Secure AI for the enterprise

Tyk's AI management solutions address key challenges in AI governance, security, and integration. They enable organisations to deploy AI capabilities while maintaining oversight, managing risks, and meeting enterprise standards.

## AI integration architecture and its importance

Integrating AI into existing systems requires a structured architecture that connects models, APIs, and specialised tools securely and efficiently.

A managed AI integration architecture provides:

- **Standardisation** to ensure interoperability across AI components
- **Security** across AI workflows and data interactions
- **Governance** to monitor and control AI usage and data
- **Scalability** for enterprise-wide deployment and increasing complexity
- **Interoperability** across vendors and services

Without a structured approach, organisations risk fragmented solutions, security gaps, and unmanaged AI usage ("shadow AI"). By integrating AI into existing systems, enterprises can achieve a more secure and efficient approach to AI management.

## Tykâ€™s AI management capabilities

Tyk provides two key solutions for AI management:

### [AI Studio](/ai-management/ai-studio/overview)

Tyk AI Studio is a platform for managing and deploying AI applications securely and at scale. It provides:

- **Centralised governance** with role-based access control and compliance tracking
- **Cost management** through usage monitoring and budgeting tools
- **Security features** including unified access controls and credential management
- **Developer enablement** via curated AI service catalogues
- **Collaboration tools** through intuitive AI interfaces

AI Studio supports enterprises in reducing unauthorised AI usage by providing central management across all AI interactions.

### [Tyk MCPs](/ai-management/mcps/overview)

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) provides a standardised method for AI components to interact with external resources.

With MCPs, organisations can:

- **Integrate securely** with external AI providers and services
- **Build custom tools** for AI assistants and workflows
- **Access resources** such as files, APIs, and databases
- **Enhance AI workflows** with contextual information

MCPs help expand AI system functionality by enabling secure, standardised interactions between services.

### How AI Studio and MCPs work together

Tyk AI Studio and Tyk MCPs are complementary:

- **AI Studio** offers governance, monitoring, and development tooling for AI management.
- **Tyk MCPs** provide secure connections to external services and APIs.

Together, they create a flexible, governed framework for managing AI applications at scale.
