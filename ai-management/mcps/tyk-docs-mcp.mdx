## Overview

*Tyk Docs MCP* is a tool [MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontext/spec) exposing the Tyk documentation to connected AI assistants. It enables the users of AI assistants "talk to" Tyk's documentation. Instead of searching manually, users can ask natural-language questions — and get answers backed by Tyk official docs. The tool makes AI-assisted support, troubleshooting, and documentation exploration fast and reliable.


Here you can see the AI assistant chooses to use Tyk Docs MCP (*Cline* in VS Code) while answering the query *How do I set a rate limit for a Tyk API?*:

## Quick Start

To get started quickly, the primary way to use it is by configuring your AI assistant to run it directly as an MCP tool.

### Requirements
- [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed
- Internet access to reach Tyk documentation index
- MCP-compatible AI assistant that supports connecting to external MCP-compatible tool servers (e.g. Claude, Cursor, Vercel AI SDK, Cline extension in VS Code etc.), 

### Configure your AI Assistant

To connect the tool with MCP-compatible assistants, you need to register it as an MCP server. Most AI assistance share similar MCP server definition. This is the definition for *docs-mcp*:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "tyk-docs-search": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@tyk-technologies/docs-mcp@latest"
        ],
        "enabled": true
      }
  }
}
```

**Step 1.** 
To enable the tool, paste the above configuration into your AI assistant’s MCP config file

- **Claude Desktop**: For MacOS, you need to update `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`. See the [Claude Desktop setup instructions](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/api-to-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-in-claude-desktop) for Windows OS and more customization options.
- **Cursor**: See the [Cursor setup guide](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/api-to-mcp#cursor) for instruction on setting it with Cursor.

**Step 2.**
Once connected, ask the AI to perform an operation as suggested in the [use cases above](/#use-cases)


## How It Works under the hood

Tyk Docs MCP tool is built on top of the [@buger/probe-docs-mcp project](https://github.com/buger/docs-mcp). This package comes with Tyk's documentation already bundled, offering a plug-and-play experience for users who want to integrate Tyk documentation into their AI assistants.
