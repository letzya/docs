## 2.0 Release Notes
### 2.0.0 Release Notes

#### Release Date 26 September 2024

#### Breaking Changes

##### 1. URL Path Matching Configuration Changes

Tyk Charts v2.0 introduces a **breaking change** related to URL path matching behavior in the Tyk Gateway. If you are using Tyk Gateway versions 5.0.14 (2023 LTS), 5.3.5 (2024 LTS), or 5.5.1 (latest feature branch) or above, two new configuration options have been added to the Gateway:

- `http_server_options.enable_path_prefix_matching`
- `http_server_options.enable_path_suffix_matching`

These options allow more restrictive URL path matching by controlling whether the request path matches the start or end of the specified pattern. If both are set to `true`, Tyk enforces "exact" path matching. By default, these options are set to `false` in the Gateway to avoid breaking existing configurations.

However, starting with **Tyk Charts v2.0**, these options will be set to `true` by default, enforcing stricter security by requiring precise path matches. This change applies to new installations or upgrades via Tyk Charts v2.0 and above.

From this version of Tyk Charts we also set the following configuration option to `true` by default as part of the stricter path matching:

- `http_server_options.enable_strict_routes`

**Impact on existing users:**

- The change is **backward-compatible** for users upgrading their Tyk Gateway directly (i.e. not via Helm Chart), because by default, these features will not be active. This ensures that existing configurations are not affected if you update the Gateway manually.
- However, **if you install or upgrade via Tyk Charts v2.0**, these options will be set to `true` by default. This means stricter URL path matching will be enforced automatically, which could impact your existing routes or configurations if you're not prepared for it. Please ensure you understand and test these new configurations before upgrading your production environment.

**Action required:**

- Familiarize yourself with URL matching in Tyk [here](/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching).
- For production setup guidance, see [this guide](/tyk-self-managed#ensure-you-are-matching-only-the-url-paths-that-you-want-to-match).
- Configure the new options via the Helm chart, and test the changes in a non-production environment before upgrading.

##### 2. Default Tyk Component Versions

This release changes the default component versions in Tyk Charts v2.0 to **Long-Term Support (LTS)** versions for greater stability in production environments. The new defaults are:

|Tyk Component|Default Version|Customization Parameter|
|---|---|---|
|Tyk Gateway|5.3.5 LTS|`--set tyk-gateway.gateway.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Dashboard|5.3.5 LTS|`--set tyk-dashboard.dashboard.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Pump|1.11.0|`--set tyk-pump.pump.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk MDCB|2.7.0|`--set tyk-mdcb.mdcb.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Developer Portal|1.10.0|`--set tyk-dev-portal.image.tag=<desired-version>`|
|Tyk Operator|0.18.0|`--set tyk-operator.image.tag=<desired-version>`|

If you need to use a different version for any component, adjust the Helm chart parameters during installation or upgrade.

<ul>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Support for New Path Matching Configuration Options'}>
Tyk Charts v2.0 introduces support for the newly added Tyk Gateway configuration options: `enable_path_prefix_matching` and `enable_path_suffix_matching`. These settings allow more secure and explicit URL matching by restricting path pattern matching to the start or end of the request path. This enhancement benefits customers who need more precise route matching to ensure that only intended paths are matched in production environments, reducing the risk of unintentional routing.

URL path matching mode is configurable using these `tyk-gateway` chart parameters:

- `gateway.enablePathPrefixMatching` (default to `true`)
- `gateway.enablePathSuffixMatching` (default to `true`)
- `gateway.enableStrictRoutes` (default to `true`)

Learn more about the settings in the [URL Path Matching](/getting-started/key-concepts/url-matching) documentation.

</li>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Configuration for Extra Volume Mounts in Tyk-Bootstrap'}>
This release adds support for `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` parameters in the `tyk-bootstrap` charts, enabling users to mount additional volumes. This is especially useful for users with custom storage or configuration needs in their deployments, offering more flexibility in managing their Tyk installation.

The options are configurable using these `tyk-bootstrap` chart's parameters:

- `bootstrap.extraVolumes` (default to empty list)
- `bootstrap.extraVolumeMounts` (default to empty list)

##### Changed

<ul>

<li>
<Expandable title={'Default to Long-Term Support (LTS) Versions for Components'}>
Tyk Charts v2.0 now defaults to Long-Term Support (LTS) versions for Tyk Gateway and Tyk Dashboard. This change ensures greater stability and long-term support for customers deploying Tyk in production environments, reducing the risk of issues due to feature branch releases. Users can still override these versions if needed, but the default will provide a more predictable upgrade path for most use cases.

This section should be a table that presents the third-party dependencies and tools compatible with the release. Compatible is used in the sense of those versions tested with the releases. Such information assists customers considering upgrading to a specific release.

Additionally, a disclaimer statement was added below the table, for customers to check that the third-party dependency they decide to install remains in support.

An example is given below for illustrative purposes only. Tested Versions and Compatible Versions information will require discussion with relevant squads and QA. */}

With PostgreSQL v11 has reach [EOL](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) on November 2023, we can no longer guarantee full compatibility with this version of the database. If you are [using PostgreSQL](/tyk-self-managed#postgresql) we recommend that you upgrade to a version that we have tested with, as indicated below.

| Third Party Dependency                                     | Tested Versions        | Compatible Versions    | Comments |

Given the time difference between your upgrade and the release of this version, we recommend customers verify the ongoing support of third-party dependencies they install, as their status may have changed since the release.

#### Deprecations
{/* Required. Use the following statement if there are no deprecations, or explain if there are */}
###### MDCB: Deprecated healthcheck_port and replaced with http_port

Starting with MDCB v2.6.0, the configuration parameter `http_port` has been introduced to replace the original `healthcheck_port`. This new HTTP port is designed to expose various endpoints for monitoring and debugging MDCB. For consistency and future compatibility, it is recommended to use `mdcb.httpPort`.

####### Backward compatibility:

The `mdcb.httpPort` parameter is backward compatible, meaning it will function correctly with all existing MDCB versions, ensuring a smooth transition.

####### Recommendations for users:

- **Helm Chart Adjustments**: Update your Helm chart configurations to use `mdcb.httpPort` instead of `mdcb.probes.healthcheckPort` to define the HTTP port.

<ul>

<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Gateway: Add option to enable fixed window rate limiter'}>
New field `gateway.enableFixedWindowRateLimiter` added to `tyk-gateway` chart.

This feature allows users to enable fixed window rate limiter in the Gateway. The fixed window rate limiter feature permits requests up to the configured rate limit within a specified time window, after which any additional requests are blocked until the next window. This method has minimal impact on Redis and is straightforward to implement. However, it should be noted that it does not protect against traffic spikes as it lacks spike arrest behavior. The default value for this setting is `false`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dashboard and Gateway: Add init containers resources parameters'}>
Optional parameters `dashboard.initContainers.initAnalyticsConf.resources` and `gateway.initContainers.setupDirectories.resources` added to set resources for init containers in Dashboard and Gateway charts respectively.

This feature is introduced to allow the definition of resource parameters for init containers, which is particularly useful in environments with namespace quotas that require specific resource definitions. Users can now specify the resources for init containers to comply with namespace resource quotas, ensuring that the init containers operate within the defined resource limits. The resource parameters can be defined at below locations.

Tyk Dashboard chart

```yaml
dashboard:
  initContainers:
    initAnalyticsConf:
      resources: {}
      # If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
      # requests:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
```

Tyk Gateway chart

```yaml
gateway:
  initContainers:
    setupDirectories:
	    resources: {}
      # If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
      # requests:
      #   cpu: 100m
      #   memory: 128Mi
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'MDCB: Added SSL configurations for MDCB HTTP server'}>
Added `mdcb.httpServerOptions` for SSL configuration of the MDCB HTTP server.

This feature allows users to enable SSL for the MDCB HTTP server by configuring SSL-specific options. Users can enhance the security of their MDCB HTTP server by enabling SSL. The configuration includes settings such as `useSSL`, `certificateKeyFile`, `certificateCertFile`, and `minVersion`. For other HTTP server options, users can utilize `extraEnvs` to configure additional parameters.

```yaml
mdcb:
  # defines the SSL/TLS settings for the http server where the healthcheck is exposed
  httpServerOptions:
    # if enabled then the endpoints will be served over https
    useSSL: true
    certificateKeyFile: /path-to-cert-keyfile
    certificateCertFile: /path-to-certfile
    
    # For TLS 1.0 use 769, for TLS 1.1 use 770, for TLS 1.2 use 771, for TLS 1.3 use 772
    minVersion: 771
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'MDCB: Deprecated Healthcheck Port and added HTTP Port'}>
`mdcb.httpPort` added to define the port used for accessing MDCB HTTP endpoints.

This change deprecates the previous healthcheck port in favor of using a defined HTTP port for accessing MDCB HTTP endpoints. This update streamlines the configuration by consolidating the HTTP endpoints under a single port setting, making it simpler to manage and configure the MDCB health checks.

```yaml
mdcb:
  # This is the preferred port setting for MDCB >= v2.6.0.
  # Users should use httpPort instead of probes.healthCheckPort for newer versions.
  httpPort: 8181

  probes:
    # This port lets MDCB allow standard health checks.
    # It also defines the path for liveness and readiness probes.
    # It is used to set TYK_MDCB_HEALTHCHECKPORT and TYK_MDCB_HTTPPORT when mdcb >= v2.6.0
    # This field will be deprecated in upcoming release. Use `httpPort` instead.
    # healthCheckPort: 8181
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Add tyk-operator dependency to umbrella charts'}>
`global.components.operator` added to determine whether the Tyk Operator component should be installed.

This feature adds a dependency on the Tyk Operator to the umbrella charts, facilitating the installation of the Tyk Operator component. Users can now easily install the Tyk Operator component by setting the `global.components.operator` parameter. Note that the Tyk Operator requires `cert-manager` to be installed beforehand. It also expects secret `tyk-operator-conf` is present in the installation namespace. You can enable bootstrapping at `global.components.bootstrap` if you are working on a new installation to have this secret created for you. Refer to the Tyk Operator [installation guide](/api-management/automations/operator#install-and-configure-tyk-operator) for detailed information on pre-requisites.

```yaml
global:
  components:
    # operator determines whether Tyk Operator component should be installed or not.
    # Tyk Operator needs cert-manager to be installed beforehand. Make sure that cert-manager is installed.
    # For further details, please refer to https://tyk.io/docs/api-management/automations#install-and-configure-tyk-operator/
    operator: false
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Add annotations to Tyk Stack and component Helm Charts'}>
Introduced `annotations` values to the Tyk stack and component Helm charts to define annotations for Deployments or StatefulSets.

This enhancement allows users to define custom annotations for the Deployments or StatefulSets of Tyk components. Annotations are useful for supporting automated reloading of the Gateway or other components using tools like reloader. Previously, the Helm charts did not support any annotations at the deployment level.

Users can now add custom annotations to facilitate automation and improve the management of Tyk components. The following annotations have been added:
- Dashboard: `dashboard.annotations` for Tyk Dashboard Deployment/StatefulSet
- Dev Portal: `annotations` for Tyk Developer Portal Deployment/StatefulSet
- Gateway: `gateway.annotations` for Tyk Gateway Deployment/StatefulSet
- MDCB: `mdcb.annotations` for MDCB Deployment/StatefulSet
- Pump: `pump.annotations` for Tyk Pump Deployment

##### Fixed

<ul>

<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'Dashboard: Fix misconfiguration preventing detail log display with Mongo Pump'}>
This fix addresses a misconfiguration in the Dashboard chart that was causing the Log Browser not showing API activity logs for users utilizing Mongo Pump. The default configuration `dashboard.useShardedAnalytics` is now set to `true`, ensuring proper log visibility. Users who use Mongo Pump will now be able to view the API activity log as expected. Additionally, the correct Dashboard environment variable `TYK_DB_USESHARDEDANLAYTICS` is now set using `dashboard.useShardedAnalytics`. This enhancement ensures accurate log visibility and improves the overall user experience with the Dashboard by properly configuring sharded analytics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Gateway: Fix issue with control port and `latest` container image tag'}>
Resolved an issue in the Gateway chart that prevented the use of a container image with the `latest` tag when `gateway.control.enabled` is set to `true`.

This fix addresses a problem in the Gateway chart where enabling the control port (`gateway.control.enabled`) would cause an error if the container image tag was set to `latest`. The helm chart template previously assumed that all images would use semantic versioning.

Users can now use the `latest` tag for container images even when the control port is enabled. This enhancement removes the restriction and assumption of semantic versioning, providing more flexibility in specifying container image tags.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dev Portal: Fix issue that prevent bootstrap and developer portal to be enabled at the same time'}>
Resolved an issue in `tyk-stack` and `tyk-control-plane` chart that prevented bootstrap and devPortal components to be enabled at the same time.

When user deploy Developer Portal using `tyk-stack` or `tyk-control-plane` Helm Chart, there was a problem before that bootstrapping and devPortal cannot be enabled at the same time. It was because dev portal was depending on secret `tyk-dev-portal-conf` to start up but the secret can only be created after all pods has been created successfully via the bootstrapping job. This problem arises when user use `--wait` flag in helm install or use ArgoCD for installation.

We have fixed this issue by not passing required org ID and API key as command option during portal startup. The dev portal is configured after Pod creation via Dev Portal API.

<ul>

<li>
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title={'OSS: Simplify Tyk Operator setup with Kubernetes Secret creation'}>
When you set `operatorSecret.enabled` to `true` in the `tyk-oss` chart, a Kubernetes Secret named `tyk-operator-conf` will be automatically created in the same namespace. This secret is essential for connecting Tyk Operator to the Gateway, enabling seamless management of Tyk API resources. To learn more about setting up Tyk Operator, check out [Tyk Operator installation](/api-management/automations/operator#install-and-configure-tyk-operator).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'MDCB: Enhanced analytics configuration options'}>
We have introduced new configuration options for handling analytics data flow in MDCB deployments. By default, MDCB stores aggregated analytics data from the data plane pump to SQL/Mongo. Additionally, users have the flexibility to enable Pump in the control plane, allowing MDCB to send analytics to Redis instead.

Here are the default configurations:
```yaml 
mdcb:
  # When it is set to true, instead of sending analytics directly to MongoDB / SQL,
  # MDCB can send analytics to Redis. This will allow tyk-pump to pull
  # analytics from Redis and send to your own data sinks.
  # It is used to set TYK_MDCB_FORWARDANALYTICSTOPUMP
  forwardAnalyticsToPump: false

  # This enables saving analytics in multiple keys as oppose to just having one.
  # It is useful when using a Redis cluster.
  # It also only works when TYK_MDCB_FORWARDANALYTICSTOPUMP is set to true.
  enableMultipleAnalyticsKey: true

  # This should be set to true if you choose not to store selective analytics
  dontStoreSelective: false

  # This should be set to true if you choose not to store aggregate analytics
  dontStoreAggregate: false

  # If set to true then it will not store analytics for tags having prefix specified in the list.
  # NB: Prefix “key-” is added in the list by default. This tag is added by gateway for keys.
  ignoreTagPrefixList: []

  # If enabled, it will store analytics for all the endpoints, irrespective of Track Endpoint plugin.
  trackAllPaths: false

  # If enabled, aggregate data will be generated per minute.
  storeAnalyticsPerMinute: false   
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Tyk Control Plane: Added option to enable Dashboard hybrid organization'}>
We've added a convenient option to enable dashboard hybrid organization during bootstrapping. This eliminates the manual step of calling the Dashboard Admin API post-deployment to enable hybrid organization, which is essential for MDCB deployment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Enhanced security with customizable Pod or Container security context'}>
To harden security, we have made security context of all Pods and Containers customizable. Also, we have set `runAsNonRoot: true` in all Pod's `securityContext`. This prevents the Pods from running as root users, ensuring compatibility with the [*Restricted* Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Gateway: Allow Gateway to be updated if secret value is updated'}>
We've introduced an annotation with a checksum of the secret as a value, triggering a deployment change when the secret is updated. This ensures that pods are replaced promptly, immediately utilizing the new values from the secret. This logic applies if `global.secrets.useSecretName` is not set, as the secret is then not part of the chart.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Customizable Pod Labels Across All Components'}>
Now, you have the flexibility to customize Pod labels in all component charts. Simply populate the `podLabels` field with your desired content, and it will be added as pod labels.

<Accordion title={'Gateway/Pump: Removed the command in Gateway and Pump pod templates'}>
We've removed unnecessary commands from the Gateway and Pump pod templates, allowing for the utilization of entrypoint scripts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dashboard: Allow arbitary image tags in tyk-dashboard'}>
Now, you can use arbitrary image tags, including non-Semantic Versioning tags like `latest` for Dashboard. We've bypassed version checking in the Dashboard Deployment template to accommodate this flexibility.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dashboard: Classic portal bootstrapping disabled by default'}>
To avoid confusion with the latest Developer Portal, Classic Portal bootstrapping is now disabled by default in the Dashboard. If you wish to utilize the Classic Portal, simply enable it by setting `tyk-bootstrap.bootstrap.portal` to `true` in either the Tyk Stack or Tyk Control Plane chart.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Dashboard: Deprecation of `hashKeys` field'}>
The `dashboard.hashKeys` field is now deprecated. Instead, users should utilize the `global.hashKeys` field to set key hashing. This ensures configuration alignment across Gateway, Dashboard, and MDCB components.
