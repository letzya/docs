<h4 id="Changelog-v1.7.0">Changelog</h4>
##### Added
<ul>
<li>
<details>
<summary>Load Proxy Settings from Environment Variables</summary>

TIB now respects `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables when making outbound connections. This change ensures compatibility with air-gapped Kubernetes environments where external services can only be accessed via an HTTP proxy.

</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Dynamic State Query Support in OAuth2 Flow</summary>

The OAuth2 "state" field can now be dynamically set via the URL or form-encoded body. This improvement allows integration with external APIs that require custom state values, ensuring compliance with various regulatory and enterprise authentication requirements.
</details>
</li>

<li>
<details>
<summary>Improved Multi-Group Permission Mapping for Identity Providers</summary>

Previously, TIB assigned a user to the last matched group when multiple groups were mapped, regardless of the identity provider (SAML, LDAP, OAuth, OIDC, etc.). The new functionality introduces support for multi-group mapping, allowing permissions to be merged. This update is backward compatible and ensures that multi-group rights (combined permissions) are only applied if the user does not have a `groupId` assigned via the Dashboard.
</details>
</li>
</ul>

##### Security Fixes
