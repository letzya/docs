This section moves from concepts to hands-on implementation, providing the practical steps needed to start with Tyk Governance.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation and setup process for Tyk Governance, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

### License Requirements
- Valid Tyk license with Governance feature enabled

### System Requirements

**For Tyk Governance Hub:**
- No local system requirements as Tyk Governance is fully hosted and managed by Tyk in the cloud

**For Tyk Governance Agent:**
- Minimum 1 CPU core
- 512MB RAM
- 1GB available disk space
- Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+, or equivalent)
- Docker (if using containerized deployment)
- Kubernetes (optional, for orchestrated deployments)

### Permission Requirements

**For Agent Installation:**
- Read access to your API providers (Tyk, AWS API Gateway, etc.)
- Ability to create and manage containers or services in your environment
- Network configuration permissions to establish outbound connections
- Permission to create and manage secrets for storing API credentials

### Network Requirements

**For Tyk Governance Agent:**
- Inbound access from the Tyk Governance Hub (default 50051 for gRPC)
- Outbound access to your API providers
- Outbound HTTPS (port 443) access to the Tyk Governance Hub
- If API Provider gateways run on different networks, network routes must allow the agent to communicate with those networks

## System Architecture

Tyk Governance follows a cloud-hosted service model with customer-deployed agents, creating a secure and flexible architecture that respects your network boundaries while providing centralized governance.

### High-Level Architecture

### Deployment Models

#### Tyk Cloud with Automatic Agent

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Tyk Cloud"
        GS["Governance Service"]
        CP["Cloud Control Plane"]
        AG["Auto-deployed Agent"]
        
        GS --- AG
        AG --- CP
    end
    
    User["User"] --> GS
```

**When to use this model:**
- You exclusively use Tyk Cloud for API management
- You want the simplest possible setup with minimal configuration
- You don't have any APIs on other platforms that need governance

#### Tyk Cloud with Customer-Deployed Agents

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Tyk Cloud"
        GS["Governance Service"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Customer Environment"
        A1["Agent"] --- TG["Tyk Dashboard (Self-Managed)"]
        A2["Agent"] --- AWS["AWS API Gateway"]
    end
    
    A1 <--> GS
    A2 <--> GS
    
    User["User"] --> GS
```

**When to use this model:**
- You use self-managed Tyk deployments (not Tyk Cloud)
- You use AWS API Gateway or other supported providers
- You need to govern APIs across providers that aren't in Tyk Cloud

#### Hybrid Deployment

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Tyk Cloud"
        GS["Governance Service"]
        CP["Cloud Control Plane"]
        AG["Auto-deployed Agent"]
        
        GS --- AG
        AG --- CP
    end
    
    subgraph "Customer Environment"
        A2["Agent"] --- AWS["AWS API Gateway"]
    end
    
    A2 <--> GS
    
    User["User"] --> GS
```

**When to use this model:**
- You use a combination of Tyk Cloud and other API platforms
- You have a mix of cloud and on-premises API deployments
- You need comprehensive governance across your entire API ecosystem

## Installation

The installation process for Tyk Governance varies depending on whether you're an existing Tyk Cloud customer and which deployment model you use.

### Requesting Access to Tyk Governance

1. **Contact Tyk for Access**
	- Reach out to your Tyk Account Manager or visit [tyk.io/contact-book-a-demo](https://tyk.io/contact-book-a-demo/)
	- Specify that you're interested in access to Tyk Governance
	- Provide information about your current API management environment

2. **Receive Access Credentials**
	- After your request is processed, you'll receive an email with:
		- URL to access the Tyk Governance Hub
		- Admin credentials for initial login
		- Instructions for next steps

3. **Initial Login**
	- Navigate to the provided Governance hub URL
	- Enter the admin credentials from the email
	- You'll be prompted to change your password on first login

### Enabling Governance Feature for Cloud Control Planes

For existing Tyk Cloud managed control planes, enabling governance is straightforward:

1. **Log in to Tyk Cloud Dashboard**
	- Navigate to your Tyk Cloud dashboard
	- Ensure you have administrative privileges

2. **Access Control Plane Settings**
	- Select the Control Plane you want to enable governance for
	- Click on "Edit Details" button

3. **Enable Governance Feature**
	- Locate the "Governance Agent" toggle
	- Enable the feature
	- Save your changes

4. **Verification**
	- An agent will be automatically deployed for your Tyk Control Plane
	- You can now access the Governance dashboard via "Governance" in the Cloud UI sidebar

### Installing a Local Agent

For environments where you need to install agents manually (non-Tyk platforms or on-premises deployments), follow these steps:

**Prerequisites for Agent Installation:**
- Access to the Governance hub to generate agent tokens
- Network connectivity between the agent and both the Governance hub and your API provider
- Docker or Kubernetes for container-based deployment (recommended)

#### Generate Agent Token

Since the UI for generating agent tokens is unavailable, you'll need to use the API to create a token. After receiving your Governance hub credentials, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain an API Key**:
	 - Log in to the Governance hub using the credentials provided in your welcome email
	 - Check your Access key under the "Settings > User Profile" section

     <img src="img/governance/user-profile.png" alt="" />

2. **Create an Agent using the API**:

```bash
# Replace these values with your actual information
GOVERNANCE_URL="https://your-governance-instance.tyk.io"
API_KEY="your-access-key"
AGENT_NAME="My AWS Agent (US)"

# Create agent first
curl -s -X POST --location "$`{GOVERNANCE_URL}`/api/agents/" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $`{API_KEY}`" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "'"$`{AGENT_NAME}`"'"
  }'
```

Example response which shows that an agent is created in INACTIVE state:

```json
{"id":"a51d9bd0-bafe-4749-8285-e18641b151f2","name":"My AWS agent (US)","last_heartbeat":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","status":"INACTIVE","providers":null}
```

```bash
# Extract agent ID from response
AGENT_ID="a51d9bd0-bafe-4749-8285-e18641b151f2"
```

3. **Generate an Agent Token using the API**:

Now you can generate an access token for the agent.

```bash
# API call to create an agent token
curl -X POST "$`{GOVERNANCE_URL}`/api/auth/token/" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $`{API_KEY}`" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "'"$`{AGENT_ID}`"'"
  }'
```

    Example response:

    ```json
    {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    }
    ```

4. **Save the token securely**:

	 - Copy the `token` value from the response
	 - Store it securely, as you'll need it for agent configuration
	 - Note: This token cannot be retrieved later, so make sure to save it

#### Prepare Configuration

Create a configuration file named `agent-config.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
#==============================================================================
# Tyk Governance Agent Configuration
#==============================================================================

# Your Tyk Governance license key - required for agent authentication
# This is provided by Tyk when you subscribe to the Governance service
licenseKey: "your-tyk-governace-license-key"

# Configuration for connecting to the Tyk Governance dashboard/service
governanceDashboard:
  server:
    # The gRPC endpoint URL of the Tyk Governance service
    # Format: hostname:port (without protocol)
    # This will be provided in your welcome email from Tyk
    url: "your-governance-instance.tyk.io:50051"
  
  auth:
    # Authentication token for this agent

      region: "us-east-1"
      
      # Optional: Temporary session token if using temporary credentials
      # Required only when using AWS STS temporary credentials
      sessionToken: "your-aws-session-token"

#==============================================================================
# Agent Settings
#==============================================================================

# Log level controls verbosity of agent logs
# Options: debug, info, warn, error

# Health probe configuration for monitoring agent health
# Used by container orchestration systems like Kubernetes
healthProbe:
  server:
    # Port on which the health probe server will listen
    # Ensure this port is not used by other services
    port: 5959
```

#### Deploy the Agent

  **Docker Deployment:**

```bash
# Replace it with your Tyk Governance license key
LICENSE_KEY="tyk-governance-license-key"
VERSION="latest"

docker run -d --name tyk-governance-agent \
  -v $(pwd)/agent-config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  -e TYK_AGENT_LICENSEKEY="$LICENSE_KEY" \
  tykio/governance-agent:$VERSION
```

  **Kubernetes Deployment:**

1. Create a Kubernetes secret for the configuration:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic agent-config \
  --from-file=config.yaml=./agent-config.yaml \
  -n your-namespace
```

2. Apply the following manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: governance-agent
  namespace: your-namespace # Replace with your namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: tyk-governance-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: tyk-governance-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agent
        image: tykio/governance-agent:latest # Replace with an available version tag
        env:
        - name: TYK_AGENT_LICENSEKEY
          value: your-governance-license #Replace with your license key
        ports:
        - name: health
          containerPort: 5959
          protocol: TCP
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: health
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /live
            port: health
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/config.yaml
          name: agent-config
          subPath: config.yaml
      volumes:
      - name: agent-config
        secret:
          secretName: agent-config
          items:
          - key: config.yaml
            path: config.yaml

```

Apply with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f agent-deployment.yaml
```

#### Verify Agent Connection

1. Check if the agent is running properly:

    ```bash
    # For Docker
    docker logs tyk-governance-agent

    # For Kubernetes
    kubectl logs -l app=tyk-governance-agent -n your-namespace
    ```

 2. Look for log messages indicating a successful connection:

```
Starting license validation... 
License validated successfully. Valid till: ...
starting agent
agent started successfully
waiting agent to establish health check
starting health probes HTTP server","addr":":5959
authenticated and established health stream
health check established, waiting for sync stream
agent registered successfully and established sync stream with governance dashboard
waiting for sync requests from the dashboard
```

####  Trigger Initial Sync

1. In the Governance hub, navigate to "API Repository"
2. Click the "ReSync" button to initiate synchronisation
